The Dark Alliance~

Darkness had enveloped the realm.  Any memories of prosperous times had

long faded and the inhabitants were desperately attempting to regain the

tranquility which had once been an expected part of their lives. 

Uncertainty now plagued the eyes of mortals and hushed whispers lingered

in the still air.  It was no longer safe to walk paths that had been once

considered mere inconveniences.  Associations were being formed to ensure

survival, but more importantly, they were being formed from the need for

knowledge and power.  Out of these dark times rose the Followers

of the Alliance.

@pFollowers of the Alliance are determined to seek out all those who

truly respect the realm and all that it has to offer.  Our existance is based

on our determination to teach others of our kind about the gifts which

have been instilled upon us.  We wish to achieve the greatest of knowledge

and abilities known to mortals of this realm.  However, we do frown upon

fraternization with any mortals of different skin color and feel that

they would be best ignored.  There is no special characteristic that a

human, elf, ent, halfling, or dwarf possesses that we do not, therefore

we do not believe there is a need for us to associate with them.  We feel

that our main responsibility is to serve and protect those of dark origin

to the best of our abilities.  We will respect all of dark origin

equally, yet our primary allegiance will always be towards fellow

Followers.  As the bonds of respect and friendship towards those within

the group prove strong, so will our persecution of any who choose to

betray the Alliance.
