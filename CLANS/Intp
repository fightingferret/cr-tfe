The Intrepid Few~
@gOur Story:@n

For a long time we travelled alone.  It was during these travels that we

found ourselves.  Each of us became skilled at our profession, and came

to stand confidently on our own.  If we had not, we whould not have found

a place here.  Our quest is difficult; we would surely have fallen.  We

came together because we want something better for the world.  To be able

to live in peace, and without fear.  But such things come at great cost. 

A constant war must be waged on the forces of darkness.  We have taken

this war upon ourselves.  Secrecy, stealth, and a knowledge of the land

are our allies.  Through these we have been able to defeat our more

numerous enemies.  But we grow in strength.  Soon we shall reveal

ourselves and enter into direct combat with our foes.  It is for this day

that we train.  Greater and greater monsters shall fall before us.  We

fight for our homes.  We fight for our villages.  We fight in the hope

that someday we will fight no more.


@bRules:@n

We are protectors and as such will do no harm to innocents.  Any of our

number who does shall be dismissed from our ranks.


@rRecruiting:@n

We will accept any to our cause, so long as they are free of evil.  We

will observe them for a time to ensure this.


@yRequirements:@n

Any who join us must prove their skill.  This will be achieved by both

achieving level 10, and showing a knowledge of the realm.


@cDues:@n

There are no set dues for the clan, nor any equipment cost.  All should

give what they can, none should give more than they can afford.  The clan

is not here for material advancement.
