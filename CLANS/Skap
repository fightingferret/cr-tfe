The Shadow Knights of Ages Past~

There are many great and powerful armies in the legends passed down to us

by our elders and in stories whispered around the campfire.  None were

more renowned nor feared as the Shadow Knights.


@R::::::::::::@n  The war between darkness and light has always been fierce and

@R:@W.===,@R::::::@n  relentless.  The armies of darkness outnumbered the armies of

@R:@W:@R::::::@W_@R:::@n  light, but often fought among themselves as much as against the

@R:@W"==___(@r.@W`@R::@n  enemy.  Having grown tired of the low wages and internal

@R:::@W<<<< \,@R::@n  strife among the dark armies, an elite few broke away to form

@R:::.......::@n  a company of mercenaries.  The true identities of these

@R '::::::::'@n   mercenaries were shrouded in secrecy, with many of the company

@R    '::'@n      adopting nicknames and aliases to help keep them anonymous.


The company itself was far from secret, hiring themselves out to the very

armies they had left behind, they launched many successful campaigns

against the enemy.  They always completed the missions for which they

were hired, often winning where the dark armies had failed.  The only

assignments they turned down were from those who refused to pay their

fees.


In time, these mercenaries gained the respect and confidence of the

common people.  The commoners began to call them Shadow Knights, as much

out of respect for the companies fighting expertise, as from fear of

their ruthless and secretive reputations.  The crest of the Shadow

Knights (a white scorpion poised to strike against a blood-red field)

became an omen of defeat for the armies of light, as well as a badge of

honor for the races of darkness.


As the years went by, the company of knights became very rich and held

considerable influence.  By this time the dark races position had became

strong, and the need for mercenaries had all but passed.  The company

cast off the role of mercenaries, and proclaimed themselves overlords. 

Kingdoms throughout the realm paid tribute or felt their wrath.


The newly proclaimed overlords then decided that the people of the land

were unfit to rule over themselves, and that many races of the world did

not deserve their continued survival.  They outlawed any dealings with

the light races of the realm.  Over the rest they assumed the ruling

power, enforcing it with an iron fist.


These were good times for the Shadow Knights and for all who recognized

their supremacy.  Many of the light races were now near extinction and

forced into hiding, and those who remained were scattered and

disorganized.


Then came disaster, a war among the gods wreaked great destruction on the

world and its inhabitants.  The realm for all practical purposes ceased

to exist.  Its cites and towns lay in ruin and the people of the realm

were scattered to the winds.  In the aftermath of the destruction, the

company was forced to disband, having suffered heavy losses from within

every level of its ranks.


The hidden races of light gradually returned to the land.  The peoples of

the realm rebuilt their towns and cites.  And as the years went steadily

by, the Shadow Knights became dwindling figures of legend, then myth, and

then nearly forgotten altogether.

Now, as the dawn of a new era is upon us, with tension between light and

darkness again growing strong, new leaders are raising the banner of

their forefathers.  Determined to bring back the prosperity of old, the

company has returned to rebuild itself and restore the land to its proper

order.  The names of these new leaders are unknown, but among the

companys ranks the infamous red and white crest can again be seen bearing

the proud name "Shadow Knights of Ages Past".


Any who seek out the Shadow Knights in hopes of joining their ranks are

to be turned away.  Our members are carefully chosen for their abilities,

strength, and loyalty.  Many of the light races are excluded from joining

the company, as are those who display soft or unorganized outlooks on

life.  We recruit our ranks from among the dark peoples of the realm. 

Giving memberships to only those we deem worthy and who are eventually

invited to join us.


Company members look out for each other, and hostile actions from one

company member toward a fellow "family" member are not tolerated. 

Punishment ranges from being thrown out as a traitor, to several lesser

punishments common among military organizations.  Attacks against a

fellow knight from outside the company will be met with quick and deadly

force by the company as a whole.
