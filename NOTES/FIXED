#NOTES

Umm~
Sionell~
this is all from info death Paradisium killed by the spectre of a dwarven

honor guard.  Item #3, a home-spun cloak returned to the estate of a

deceased character.  Item #9, a hard leather cap returned to the estate

of a deceased character.  Dravic killed by a giant black beetle.

why does that deceased auction stuff appear here?

----

The 'deceased character' in auction refers to a character which auctioned

something and then deleted, not one who died in battle.  The items at

that point go out of the game entirely.

Rings of Courage~
Atrax~
Rings of Courage will blow up on you even if you type 'flee' in

conversation sometimes, and also if a situation happens like aspect of

pride attempts to force you to flee, they blow up even if you are

berserked/etc.  and do not actually flee.  This seems kind of buggy,

since I did not actually flee.  I realize this is a 'seems buggy because

I think it's hosed' note, so take it as you wish...  I didn't type flee,

didn't want to flee, couldn't scream because I was berserked, and didn't

flee, yet my rings blew up on me just the same.


@yOkay, here's what I think.  The only way the program is triggered is if

you type flee as a command.  Since the only command you would use in

conversation is a say or tell or whatever, I don't buy into it.  Although

I've seen stranger things happen.  If it is happening, then I suggest

posting a small log of what happened.  Fighting a mob that forces you to

flee is the same as typing flee yourself.  In the mob's code, it in

essence forces you to 'flee' as if you typed it yourself.  Rings blow up

when you show a lack of courage.  Attempted fleeing, forced or otherwise

is grounds for a damaged hand.  On the bright side, the ring is still

bugged in your favor and will most likely not be able to be fixed.  So,

consider it a balancing act.

slisp~
Arathorn~
slisp contains a 'p', which I cannot seem to pronounce without using my

lips.  Lizardmen aren't supposed to have lips, so how do they pronounce

the 'p' in slisp?

--

A) They dont.  the term slisp is possibly just the name given to the

lizardman language by outsiders.

B) Phonetically, this morpheme might sound different.

C) Give me a break.

Racial Stats/Descriptions~
Thunor~
Just surveyed the races available at creation to see what changes had

been made, found a few things that are inconsistent.

The quick summary of races screen when you create [has the header "The

following races exist in the world"] says: 

Lizardman: Strong, wise, but not very bright

[But lizard stats for wis are now identical to human.]

Orcs: Strong, but slow and dumb

[However Orc dex is now identical to human.]

Goblins: Quick and tough little squirts

[This is the strangest one of the bunch, it looks like somehow the goblin

stats got overwritten with halfling stats.  Goblins are now identical to

halflings statwise...  with above average dex and *int* (???) but below

average str and *con* ("tough"?)]

It was suggested to me by another player that perhaps this was an

intentional change and the summary screen was simply out of date, but the

recently updated help goblin file agrees with the summary screen, not the

current stats.

For instance it says they are "tough and wily" possessing unusual

"resistance to disease and infection" and live off the castoffs of other

races...  certainly sounds like a high con/low int race.

Cows are considered horse sized by the code.  Though this is not entirely

the other bug concerns the properties of TFE wool.  Wool is a fire

Calm in ants~
Demok~
I walk into a soldier ant and a worker ant, so both attack me, like they

calm on the soldier.  The soldier ant stops attacking me, but the worker

is still fighting, like he should.  So I start casting calm on the

worker, but in the meantime the soldier ant has reentered the battle,

assisting the worker ant.  Basically I calmed both ants multiple times,

but the kept on assisting the other one after being calmed, this doesn't

make sense.


***

These mobs assist each other.  This is exactly how this spell is supposed to work.

Rue

Obviously they assist each other, but isn't the purpose of calm to stop a

mob from attacking you?  If it's calmed it should become docile and just

sit there like a good little ant.

No.  This works only for one 'docile' mob.  Those that assist will still

Not really.  Weapons changed, damage they can do armed is still greater

You can read this two ways, either and both of which I intended.

Way(1): Some ice can be extremely clear, depending upon the conditions of

formation.  Same thing with halite or salt.

Way(2):Ice can also be opaque - meaning you CANT see through it.  This

also can be how salt looks when its crystalline structure forms.  Either

way, the desc is correct, I', not sure I see the '?', and it, like many

other things, is suppose to depend on interpretation.

Weights~
Snog~
Something seems to be wrong with weight.  I start off in a group with a

full canteen of water, a bunch of food in my backpack and am unburdened. 

I have since then run out of food and drank my canteen out of water. 

After having my canteen refilled, I find that I am now lightly burdened. 

I'm not sure what is doing this but my only guess is that when I eat and

drink it doesn't subtract the weight from my total.  If this is the case,

I'm curious if it works the same when a spell reagent gets used up, that

it won't show a lowered amount for a mage/cleric/ranger's weight and

number of items in their inv.

- Snog -

ps, will try and figure it out and post more 

****

Before my inv's weight was around 37+ and after quitting and logging back

on my inv's weight has dropped back down to 12 which is what it should be. 

It would seem to me that items that get eaten and liquids (water) that

one drinks do not get subtracted from the total weight in one's inv.

(again I'll play around some more watching the weighs and see what

happens when you eat something etc.  >

Well, this very well may not be a bug but I don't recall this ever

happening before.  The druid of Medienne Forest has managed to wander all

the way into the vaasa and is now near the root that you have to climb up. 

Should he really come this far?  I'm surprised he didn't wander into

frost giants on his way here :p

As an elf, I thought someone like yourself would understand and

appreciate the effort this poor man, a human, is going to to make sure

clothes dirty a mere human wouldnt have to travel to the Vaasa...)

The angelfish always move east when they reset, but since they can move

room unlike the crystalline dragon infant.


Hmm, seems the angelfish won't move so I've altered the code in that room.

The reason youre seeing this is because the attack on the scimitar is

extra attack can miss the same as a regular one.

If you build a house poorly, and as you wrap up construction realize a better way to do it... is the house suddenly built better or do you have to tear it down and rebuild it?

It works the same way with leech.  As you cast you improve your understanding of the mechanics and will be able to do a better job from the begining next time.

If its a problem, simply unleech the spell and recast it for the full effect of your greater knowledge.

Silence~
Jemasze~
When you are silenced it says :

@rYou are silenced and unable to cast spells!@n

But you do not need to speak for all spells, like Balm.

--

Actually, there are three schools of thought on this one.

A) You're right, but the code doesn't provide for a way to tell.


B)Actually, all spells have verbal components, except that, in the

player's interest of cutting casting times, they are not always displayed

- use your imagination.


C)Either A or B can be right, but the fact is there isn't anything we can

do about it, in case A, and in case B its an error in your favor.

the corpse of all furry animals~
Servius~
Most little furry creatures have corpses that weigh 20 lbs.  With the new

sacrificial system it would make more sense to modify these to be more

realistic and less of a burden on us players hauling corpses to alters. 

doubt both squirrels and skunks etc weigh 20 lbs.


Well, maybe if they were domesticated...


@C==

Most creatures will have a default corpse and weight depending on their

size.  While it's possible to create individual corpses for each and

every mob, it's neither fun nor important to do so.  Thus, I highly doubt

this will get changed in the near future for every mob you see.

When you enter the Chiiron Magic Shoppe for the first time, the mage

there asks you whether you could get some stuff for him, on order to

complete a newbie quest.  In order to gain the quest, you must tell the

mage 'yes'.  But, the mage does not give his name, and when trying to

tell to his keywords (mage.vast.powers) it says the 'No one found

matching...' stuff.  So, in short, you can't get the quest assigned to

you :(

And many more (I didn't feel like going through all of them)


-Debin


@C* * *@n

I went through and set these socials to what I feel are appropriate

positions.  Since meditation is considered a higher state than resting, I

believe,, I left it so that many of the socials could be done during

resting, which also means they can be done during meditation.  If you

find any that are blatently mis-positioned, mail me or post em up on the

board.  thanks alot.

the spell sleep~
Servius~
Ok, this is difficult to explain...  I was in a room with a tall shepherd

and a sheep dog.  I cast sleep on the shepherd and the dog of course

leapt to attack me.  The problem is, the shepherd was suddenly awake

(with no message saying he woke up).  So now the shepherd and dogs were

attacking me.  I realize that the dogs would probably wake the shepherd

up, but the spell is magical and trying to 'wake' any sleeping mobs put

to sleep due to a spell doesn't work.  I think the shepherd probably

should remain in his deep slumber.
