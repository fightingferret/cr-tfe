#NOTES

Welcome - Sorta~
Merior~
As you see on the motd, we are in development mode.  In order to prevent

player withdrawal, greyclaw is being kind enough to leave the site open

to players.


You are welcome to play in open areas, but we are changing them and may

close them off for development.  Feel free to post bugs, no complaints

please.


Equipment, classes, everything is constantly changing for now.  If you

can't deal with it, wait until we are really open.


Please note we WILL be back, and WILL stress role playing.

Clans~
Orb~
All clans have been deleted, all strongholds removed.  You will be forced

to recreate, and reapply, subject to new rules which will be available

when the mud comes back up for real.

FYI~
Merior~
A temporary help file called pwipe summarizes a few things you may find

of interest.

POsting mob bugs.~
Fenlyn~
POsting bugs about color codes appearing in mobs description is fruitless. 

We are still trying to get to all the mobs and adjust their appearance

fields.  We've been workign non-stop on this for about 2 weeks, so you

can imagine how hard this must be.  WE will eventually get to them, but

for now, you will have to deal with funny appearance mobs.

The Gossip Channel~
Caer~
@RAt this time, you are given 1000 gossip points as a courtesy in case

you run into problems during the testing phase of the game.  We ask that

you only use the GOSS channel in situations of emergency.  Your points

will be reduced to the normal allottment if you clutter up the GOSS

channel with babble.  For now you may use OOC to chat.  Please allow us

to leave the GOSS channel on while we work on the game.


Oh, and I'm supposed to threaten you with Rue if you don't believe *ME*. 

You have been warned. =)

Taking Away Your Fun.~
Fenlyn~
Jimbalaya, Orb, Olah, Adakar, and myself have been working night and day

to change all of the mud's objects to conform to some sort of standard.


So far, the following positions have been completed:

Feet, Arms, Finger, and Neck.


Other positions and unwearable objects are still being worked on.


This Public Service Announcement brought to you by Followers of the Bear.

Air Immortal~
Talis~
Due to heavy traffic and the occasionally misplaced mortal, Air Immortal

has been closed to undergo a maintenance check.  As a courtesy to our

valued customers, we have installed portals (Hail Portal) in Chiiron,

Voaleth, and Medienne.  This is only a temporary situation until such

time as the claudications along the trails are removed and travel is

again possible by more mundande means.  Please refrain from asking for

immortals to transfer you as you are now provided with the means at hand.


Shade and sweet water,

Talis

Re-opening~
Merior~
Expect periodic wizlock prior to the re-opening of the mud to allow

builders to make final adjustments to areas and items.  We are moving

around/modifying most of the old 'killing' areas and are keeping their

contents secret until we are officially ready for business.  Most of

these areas have been closed off for the last few weeks, but will need a

few tweaks with no one wandering about.

~
895341453
Avatars and Social Editors~
Merior~
Those wishing to be avatars or racial social editors when we re-open are

invited to send samples (description and appearance for avatars, social

or two for editors) to Orb and myself via mud-mail.  Those with previous

experience who wish to continue those roles should also re-apply in the

same manner.

~
895342013
Ent revisions~
Talis~
What exactly is an ent?  Well, primarily its the big hulking humanoid of

the light races.


Most people are familiar with one version of an ent or another, most

commonly they revolve around the concempt of a treant.  However, are ents

aren't quiet treants.  That's right, @GENTS ARE NOTE TREES@n.


In an attempt to remedy this, the help files are being revised. 

Primarily, ents should be aware that they are no longer supposed to use

descriptions of trees as their description.  If you attempt to use such a

description after the reopening you will be asked to revise it to fit the

new standards (to be set forth in the upcoming racial help file).  If you

see an ent with a tree description, inform your local imm or avatar and

we will use our special treant-hewing axe to purge you from the game.  I

hear its rather painful.  ;) 


To help forstall the arguments I'll tell you up front, this is not just

the whim of a single imm (meaning myself) or a small cadre of friends.  I

already discussed this with Merior and Greyclaw and I am merely following

what is meant to be.  Ents are the bulky light race.  Ents are not trees. 

If you insist on arguing the point, I can point you to the mudlist and

several hundred other muds, one of which I am sure will satisfy you.



Shade and sweet water,

Talis



(btw, most of the mileading ent socials have been removed in a further

attmept to decrease the confusion.  More will be added as time permits)

Webpage~
Greyclaw~
Tfe has webpage at forestsedge.com.  If you have pieces that can easily

be thrown in then give me an address to copy them from and if looks

reasonable I will copy them.

895542927
Timeline~
Greyclaw~
Will plan to reopen mud on Saturday, May 23rd.  Time will be whenever I

wake up which is typically noon Geneva time or early morning in the

United States.  All bugs won't be fixed but I think even now the mud is

tolerable and not very abusable which is the main criteria.


Major Bugs


Auction

i might just ...~
Phule~
start killing people who don't know how to format notes by now :)


@c--

I thought of that once, then I ran some quick numbers and came to the

startling conclusion that we'd end up with an active playerbase of three

people.


Oi!

And I'll bet at least two of those are the alts of imms. :P

@g- - - - -@n


@yI find it appalling that you think my mortals would dare leave their notes unformatted.  Whatever would give you such an idea?

--Fenlyn   :P @n


@c--------------------@n

Just call me -Note Formatter Extraordinaire-

-<@mStarshine@n>-


@g- - - - -@n

At least all the imms know enough to format their notes?  Right?  I mean I'd never leave an unformatted note posted anywhere because I know just how annoying it is when you can't read it.  Especially after all the whining to wade through first.

Policies (Immortal Policies, help 333)~
Merior~
I would like to take this opportunity to bring this file to the attention

of all mortals as well as immortals.  The guidelines in here are to be

followed by all immortals, and to be respected by mortals.  Please pay

particular attention to the subject of reimbursements.

~
895754017
all race files updated~
Talis~
Recently the ents' race file underwent a change to reflect the fact that

ents are not trees.


Many of you may have already noticed that the other files have been

updated as well.  I would ask that everyone planning on coming back after

the pwipe and the grand reopening at least take a look at the race file

for the race you plan on playing when you come back.  I'm pretty sure

that means most of you since you're so addicted you can't even take a

break when you know the work you do now will count for nothing.  ;) 


There have not been many drastic changes, though there are additionial

bits that may help in the creation of your apperance and descriptions as

well as the way you interact with others.  While some bits (like elves

not having facial hair and ents not being trees) that are not optional

suggestions, realize that most of these are suggestions or information on

what is considered typical and are not mandatory.  The idea is not to

create a role playing mandate that will be strictly enforced, but to

provide information so you will know what is considered "normal" and can

play your role accordingly as you see fit.  :) 


So take the bounty you have been offered and make of it what you will.



Shade and sweet water,

Talis

Reput~
Greyclaw~
Mud is now watching you to make sure you are good little rpers.  Type

reput to see what it knows.  For now nothing is being done with the info

but expect those who are naughty to never get pray points in the short

term and in the long term expect guards to attack you.


Nation grievances are a count of how many mobs you kill from a nation and

are being recorded now and may not be erased later.

PK Areas~

@YQuitting is NO LONGER allowed ( enforced by code ) in PKILL zones.@n


Currently, only two areas have been reported as PK, both of which were

known.  If I haven't sent you an "oops, thanks" message, you've found an

area that is intentionally PK.

Filter/Ignore~
Greyclaw~
Renamed ignore command filter and added ignore levels.

Use opt ignore <level> to set it.


0 : Noone

1 : Anyone you haven't introed to.

2 : Anyone not befriended

3 : Everyone


Also played with scan


0 : No autoscan

1,2 : Scan except in cities

3 : Always autoscan


And Autoloot


0 : No Autoloot

1 : Display items in corpse

2 : Get gold in corpse

3 : Get all items in corpse


For now 2 and 3 are broken and act the same as 0.

Mist-filled Marsh~
Olah~
A cataclysm has occurred just south of Pennan opening a new terrain

previously thought long gone.


Due to popular demand, a few new creatures have been added.

~
897247122
Botting~
Florian~
What is botting?  Botting is the use of autoomated scripts that perform

actions for you.  This undermines the human element from the game.  There

are several different types of botting, anything from complex triggers

cor casting spells w/o being at the terminal, to having your character

completely automated, so that she or he can get exp without the player

actually being there.


It may not be a new form, in fact I figured someone would try it sooner

or later, but the use of scripts to solve puzzles is also botting,

whether you're in front of the terminal or not.  Using scripts to ask

mobs every word in the dictionary, or partial words, is one of the most

offensive things I've seen in ages.  Not only is it getting around the

system, but its also very disturbing to think that people will resort to

this type of thing.


Any and every form of botting is illegal, but the one I just described is

more than just illegal, if anything can be.  In the future, it'll get you

banned.  Period.

I've taken the liberty of rearranging some of the quests that these type

of word completion tricks have been used against.


Enjoy.

elven longswords~
Talis~
The elven longswords collected from Thalor's corpse were only obtainable

through a bug.  There is a message given at the end of the fight that he

shatters it against a tree, thus there should not be one on his corpse.


If you have one of these you need to junk it as it does not belong in

game.  If you are one of the 3 people who did the quest and your sword

suddenly does something very peculiar please ask an imm to reimburse you

another one.  In any case, the only elven longsword you have to worry

about is the one with a dragon emblazoned on the blade.  The others work

perfectly well.


If comeone is trying to sell you one, do not buy it.  You will still need

to junk it and are not exempt.  If you are caught trying to sell one... 

well, lets just say it will go poorly for you.  This is a bug and you

have been forwarned as such.

897361004
Abuse of Bugs~
Merior~
Just a reminder to all folks that bug abuse is considered a sin on this

mud.  If you are discovered to be doing such a thing, an IMM will punish

you as he or she feels is warranted.  Bugs include taking advantage of

things that are not working properly due to code changes.  This very much

includes finding ways to kill protected mobs (like shopkeepers), wielding

a second weapon even though you don't know off-hand, etc.


Please remember: if something seems to be too good to be true, it is

likely a bug.  Report it (via mud-mail or by posting), and don't try to

do it again.  Warn your friends to do likewise.  Not all IMMS can fix the

bugs, but they can fix the bug abusers.

897394367
Castle Lag~
Caer~
I'm fairly certain castle lag is still open...but at any rate it is being

modified heavily.  Mobs will be the very last thing to change, so as of

yet there is no need to worry about it.  The room descriptions are being

modified currently, as are the actions, item placement, quests, etc

within the castle.  Every effort is being made to preserve its original

creators intent while upgrading the quality and playability of the area.

897503625
Trainers~
Florian~
A plague of amnesia has broken out among many of the townfolks who used

to provide their services as trainers.  Many of the townfolk are too far

gone to remember much of anything, leaving adventurers to scope the land

for new trainers.


@GWhat does this mean?  It means that trainers will no longer be teaching

15 or 20 skills.  It means that high level skills, anything from around

level 15 or so, will no longer be taught in towns.  It also means that

most trainers of high level skills are outcasts, hermits, ghosts,

spirits, or any other type of creature who just arent that particular

about who they teach, meaning that a lot of the nonsense about having to

worry about having the right <align><race><class><day of the week><moon

phase to train is being altered.  However, such isolated trainers are

also harder to find, teach fewer skills, and are probably only findable

by asking around for hints and/or completing a quest or two.

@RNo more one stop shopping...er...practicing in a town or with the 'high'

monks.  Finding people with the time, patience, and ability for teaching

skills beyond the basic level will be something more special than shoving

10 plat in someones face in-between going from the bank to the baker.


@MAnd a simple FYI to placate some concerns...not every skill of levels

1-15 need be taught in a town, though a _majority_ of skills level 1-5

will be taught in starting towns, with a few exceptions.  These

exceptions (like dodge) will have hints, rumors and mini quests added to

make their positioning 'easy' for newbies to find.


--

@RFor those who care, tiny tweaks have been added to warrior and cleric

pathways of choice.  Though for every class, it doesnt hurt to visit even

the most obscure mobs for help.  (Oh, and monk routes too)

for our beloved suspension bridge for which may years served us.  It has

now died of old age and now rests in the bottom of the Sea of Stars

Hill giants~
Orb~
These can no longer be affected by sweep kick, nor will they sweep kick

you.  However, they do now have the advantage of some natural armor

(thinck skin, you know).  I also lowered the coins on them slightly, as I

felt the amounts were excessive.

Codite Ore~
Orb~
Since over a thousand pieces of codite ore have been gotten illegally, I

have fixed the problem, removed the ore, and set all the weapons to

no.save.  I am sorry for the very few of you who did legitemately get

these weapons, or unknowingly bought ore from cheaters, but there is no

way for me to find the few honest individuals among the vast majority. 

There will be no reimbursements for these items.

There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man. True nobility

is being superior to your former self.


oh, yeah, what this means is something like, an area is open somewhere,

don't die in it, i hope you have fun, etc.

Dark Forces~
Adakar~
Rumors have begun to circulate among the cities of Medienne and Sos-Kul,

of dark times and even darker enemies.  Lord Richard has ordered all of

his faithful guards to protect his old friends widow, Relanya, whom is

staying within the city proper.  Lizardmen are keeping a closer watch on

their young children as reports pour in of missing family members, and

sounds of combat ringing through the swamps.  A general warning has been

sent out to one and all, merchents and townsmen, adventurer's and

farmers, 'Beware, Creature's not of this world walk among the untamed

wilds'.

Mods - July~
Greyclaw~
* Summon Format

* Added Note Iflags

* Spell Actions - $1 = caster, $2 = target, $3 = reagent, should all be

  builder fixable

* Added mess flags.  Supress messages.  Equipment does remove messages,

prepare does prepare actions, bank do withdraw and deposit.  Shops,

movement are broken.  0 is off, 1 is just friends, 2 is friends and

group, 3 is everyone - of course I didn't test it though. :)

* Sac and pray require a diety - use sac <item> to <diety> to set diety

for pray - for now you may change religions as often as you like - Caer

is example diety.  @yOn a side note, only imm with her own religion is

Caer so this doesn't work on all imms.  --Fenlyn@n

Request~
Greyclaw~
Is command request.  Request imm <reason> and request app will register

requests.  Request cancel will cancel requests.  Please use it instead of

gossip from now on.  Request with no argument will display current

requests.


Helpfile exists... help request.

All this request nonsense...~
Fenlyn~
This request command is great, but you only need to request for an

approval or an immortal once.  It will stay in the request queue until

you cancel it or quit.  So, if you need to talk to a particular immortal

(Orb for instance), your request will be there when she actually does

arrive.  Rest assured that we are reminded when there is a request

pending for us.  It appears in our prompt and annoys us.

Mysterious chanting~

An unusal amount of chanting has been heard echoing somewhere north of

Chiiron.  The droning, melodious chant seems more sorrowful than anything

else.

Typo Command~
Greyclaw~
The typo command with no argument will display room number.  Please use

it when if you need to refer to a particular room in a note.  Will help

the daemons who often get lost going from Chiiron to Medienne.


--

When posting a bug note with a room number, PLEASE, do not be too

specific in the note.  rather, post something, then use a typo message IN

the room you discovered the problem.  There are too many munchkins who

type 'typo' to 'match' the room number to something they can exploit or

wouldnt necessarily find by themselves anyway.  Make sense?

Jails Update~

The following jails have been temporarily fixed using my skills learned

Kha-Da

Vaasa

Medienne


Immortal assistance should no longer be required in these places.  By the

way if you see anything really strange (say, oh, being teleported

someplace for no particular reason), please let me know.  --Fenlyn

Roleplay issues~
Florian~
This mud is geared toward a happy medium of roleplay and game.  We

encourage you to roleplay.  But at the same time, we ask that you

remember that it is also a game insofar as other people are playing it

for fun just as you.


But while we encourage you to roleplay almost any role, roleplaying a

jerk, is not one of them.  This issue and stance will be maintained and

has been for quite some time.  It is even stated in the helpfiles.

Shortchaging people outside of pkill zones is being a jerk and not

roleplaying, as is anything else including kill stealing and kill looting. 

Such things will not be tolerated.
