Everyone should learn elvish, because it's a nicer language than humanic :P

a ) _DON'T_ learn humanic.  This means you are reduced to only insulting

b ) Wait for a passing elf to introduce themselves to you

c) Wait a further seconds for An elf idiot tells you: "intro:)"

d ) type tell elf "stick it"

Wishful thinking..~

I figured it was just a pipe dream, that it wouldn't happen but..  I was

hoping that just one time everyone could just be happy the mud was back

and not start the complaints and gripes and arguements as soon as they

possibly could.  Like maybe wait a day or even two..  *gasp* Just go out

and level, rp or whatever you find to do here you enjoy and ignore all

the little things that bug you, for just a while.

Quick question~
Griffin~
Since reputations are sorta in...

When people get to the level of the cycs and hill giants, since they are

evil, will there be any good aligned areas?  Besides derfs, I mean.

No.  You have been forsaken.

But really...

We are writing areas even as you fret.

rep~
Kami~
Its not the evilness or goodness of areas that affects you i think but

rather to what nation the mob belongs to.  ie dwarfs will affect your rep

with the khedrun, but since cycs etc.  belong to no nation it shouldnt be

a problem.

Player Etiquette, etc.~

Just a reminder, that the following actions are greatly frowned upon by

stealing/hogging.


Repeated offenses will result in punishment commensurate with the crime.

Its a Pendantic Query!!! YAY!!!~
Bliss~
on the helpfile on race trolls,

its suggests a good prank to play on

those "twig-thingy" trollie things that are dumdum (ENTS)

is to offer them dead corpsies ad

and then the ents are sad and cry.

But - if ents are this wussy about killing things and dead stuff,

how canthey justify killing innocent animals for xp?

HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM???????

It would be hard to justify.  Wait until reputations work correctly. *GRIN*

For some reason all avatars are able to set their titles.

~
895970454
just a remark..~
Marsupilami~
I find it funny to see that a mud where I lately saw a lot of notes on

favorism and (cheating?) imms have AVs with titles on levels they cannot

set their own.  Just a remark..  seems harly the behavious r that avoids

the appearance of favorism.

---

Most of the avatars actually aren't imms.  Was a bug that allowed avatars

to set title before level 10.

Eilean~
Let's dump every player in a vat of boiling oil.  The ones that die

aren't Imms with mortals who are cheating.  The ones that live and are

burned so badly they die within 12 hours are Imms with mortals that ARE

cheating.  The ones that die within 24 hours are Everyone Else.


Do something more worthwile with your time that kvetch and accuse when

you haven't got enough of a clue to fill an ant's earhole.

Its ANOTHER Pendantic Query!! yay!!~
Bliss~
This one cuse me is bored while resting:

TFE rabbits have sharp-pointed teeth?

why? herbivores only really have grinding molar-types

Told ya it was pendantic.

but this is what happens when i have 0 gsp points.

Its a conspiracy against me, I tells ya!

- Bliss


***

Go annoy a real rabbit, they do have sharp teeth like most herbivores,

the front teeeth are sharp to assist in cutting leaves etc from the

plants.

And rabbits do bite hard.  You bleed a lot.  Also rabbits are lagomorphs

and like most lagomorphs they must continually chew on things to keep

from having their teeth overgrow.

Rue

***

Me is humbled by gweat Rue god.

But can ya blame me, when me have so few gsp points???

i mean me hardly know any rabbits IRL personally

rabbits are rats?

stealing kills~
Samulayo~
I remember the immortals saying something about stealing kills.  I think

what they meant to say was that is you steal a kill expect bad things to

happen.  WARNING: AS A RESULT OF THE POPULAR DEMAND OF RP I HAVE AGREED. 

I WILL BE DOING SOME SERIOUS RPING.  I WILL HUNT DOWN AND KILL ANY HUMAN

WITHIN A PKILL ZONE.  TO FURTHER THAT, ANY HUMAN MONK.  YOU CAN ALL BLAME

WHOEVER IT WAS WHO STOLE MY KILL TODAY.  AND I AM SURE ALL THE OGRES

WOULD HELP ME.

Graf~
Would have been nice if GC's note had mentioned that tell would have been

open to any character and that keywords were no longer needed.  I spent

some serious time trying to tell to someone by keyword when I kept

getting failure messages.  Seriously, how much are we supposed to imply

from somewhat vague notes?


@gGRAF@n


I have 24 hours in a day.  If you want to pay me for writing out longer

*7 You spam a million exclamation points at a tank that is in battle.

*6 You assist a tank without their ok, after begging to group.

*5 You type Follow Jocelyn. (I am learning from poppa)

*4 The tank tells the group 'Ok you all have pray points right?'

*3 The tank tells the group 'Ok, which way to that zone again?'

*2 The tank tells you 'What is Sos-Kul?'

*1 The tank tells the group 'This is my first tank, what should we go kill?'

The cleric said WHAT??~
Lani~
@I Well, I know there's a few people out there who are just starting

cleric type characters for the first time.  Anyway, I thought I'd give ya

a few pointers on how to annoy/scare the pants off your tank.


* * Disclaimer: While all of these methods are Grif-tested, should they

not work for your choice of tank, get a new one.  ;) * * 


@I1) When the tank of your choice says 'going!', immediately gtell "I'm

out!" This method is particularly effective.


@I2) When you get to the area which you and your tank are planning to

run, loudly proclaim that this easy area is no match for your superior

healing skills.  Insist on going to a larger area.  When tank dies, well,

he chose to go to the area didn't he?


@I3) Insist that sense life detects invisible.  When tank dies, again, it

must be his fault.


@I4) When the tank asks how many cures you have prepared, be arrogant and

say that you have 'enough'.  Be sure that 'enough' includes plenty to

keep yourself alive after tank goes to play chess with Death.


@I5) Forget to turn on prompt cleric.  Spam all your cures at the

beginning of every fight, which means you will need to rest after each

battle.  A cleric needs their beauty rest.


@I6) Conviently forget that a low level cleric cannot cast restoration. 

Type your cure alias to 'cast restor <tank>' When it doesn't work, it's

the tank's fault that you weren't high enough level to actually CAST

restoration.


@I7) Remember, the life of the cleric is sacred above all else.  Save at

least half your cures for yourself.  You wouldn't want your tank to have

to spend time levelling you back after all those deaths you had from

curing him!


@I8) When tank dies, change your cure alias to the secondary tank. 

Forget to change it back.  After all, it was the second guy that was

smart enough to live, wasn't it??


Should none of these methods work to throughly aggravate your tank, feel

free to invent your own.  However, do use them sparingly, as overuse

tends to result in a decided lack of tanking type people.  Then again,

you had fun, didn't you?  *egrin* 


@MLani Cha'rhaen@n should never be listened to early in the morning.

Grouping ethics.~
B'yann~
Jst a whine at the pettiness of a lotta people ;) I know nobody has gear

yet.  But that doesnt mean you need to steal areas.  If someone is

outside an area, they're probably waiting for repop.  Talk to them, see

if yo can join up or share maybe.  Don't waltz in ignoring them :P If you

see someone else killing in an area and they were there first, leave them

to it ;) There are a lotta places to kill.  Or you could ask them to join

up or share or whatever.  *shrg* Don't wander into a zone someone else is

killing in and rn for the room that pops the good stff if you know

someone else is killing in there.  Its not polite :P 


-B'yann Al'Tor, doesn't steal zones but tends to have them stolen :P

Shouldnt chaotic evils be like 'normal' players now?  It seems they stil

have there old settings, from when they where into the pkilling.

Meaning : not being able to pray.  And probably nt being able to clan as

wel.  Was wondering if this is intentionel.  If so, shouldnt you be

warned then when creating a char?

I could really live without being able to pray, but no clanning....  Im

Imagine, you are standing in the bank, or in the checkout queue of a

supermarket, and you have slipped into that zen-like state one does at

these times where you start comparing the queue you are in to the Karma

Sutra; it has 53 positions, but only two of them seem to work.  So, while

you are there, staring into space, listening to your own, and others,

teeth grind, some one walks up to you, grabs you by one shocked hand and

starts shaking it vigorously while saying "Hi!  My names John Smith!  I

wanna be your FRIEND!!" 

Now, while this is going on, what would be going through your mind? 


Would it be, like me, the word NUTTER?  Yes, I think you would consider

that interloper to be insane.


So, why do it here?

@I"The renowned physician and distinguished gentleman of the cloth,

Brother Thomas of Medienne, recently proved, in a medical journal, that

all illnesses are caused by "bad air" given off by the already ill.

This is not only more logical and sensible than this radical idea that

illnesses may be caused by creatures too small to see - called Walruses I

believe - but also gives the opportunity of a cure; namely leaving a

freshly killed rat on a pole in the centre of town to absorb these bad

airs.


Until This remidy is effected, and I point a finger of blame at our civic

leaders for ignoring this advice, I must regretfully say I will avoid

those parts of society that are considered insane, for fear of catching

their disease myself.  In order to warn others though I will give unto

those who insanely force themselves into my conciousness - while stocks

last - a brown robe and a bell to show their diseased status.


I beseech all normal people, of whatever race or creed, to heed these

words.  Avoid those strange creatures who force themselves on you.  they

can be spotted easily by their habbits of walking up to total strangers

and ingratiating themselves, their strange language, their strange and

unsuual concepts.


Your health is at risk if you do not heed these words.

What you are forgetting kezef is that dwarves are extremely broadly built

Avatars, Imms, etc.~

Have received much mail expressing interest from folks who would like to

be either avatars or imms here.  At the present time, we are pretty much

completely staffed.  (With the possible exception of one or two late

night/early morning us-time folks.) 


Though you are of course, welcome to ask, please do not expect an

individual response.  I am kinda swamped right now, and just can't

respond to every letter personally.


I believe, however, that not all races have assigned social editors at

this point.  Those of you wishing to contribute in this manner should

send three sample socials for your race, copies to orb and myself.

If ents are no longer trees, why can they not eat meat?

Ents digestive systems are unable to break down the complex proteins

found in meats.  Rather than slowly poison themselves they forgoe the

eating of meat.

- Bwithh :)


***

Since we live in a non-scientific age where religious beliefs are more

poweful than science, look at is this way: Ents feel as though they are

cursed when they eat meat, and this developed into a moral stance against

the taking of life.

i.e. Bad stomachache = cursed by gods = Maybe killing isn't a good thing

Edgar's getting punished ;)~
Aera~
Edgar's been letting his home ec projects slide, so his parents have

banned him from the forests edge for the next two to three weeks.  He

says he hates it, but thats life and he hopes you wont forget him.  Heh,


Edgar just ICQ'd me, telling me to play his character from time to time. 

So if you see him on in the next while, its me not him.  Just a warning

there ;)

re:Query: Re: Question\~
Marik~
Actually that's not so great an answer.  If ents are morally opposed to

taking lives, then why is it that they are allowed as a player race?  All

this does is lead many many ents to doing what their race is opposed to

doing.

-Marik

Ents reluctance to take lives extends only to creatures that many other

races consider food.  Anything that attacks an ent is free game.

Re: ents~
Atrax~
Why is there so much whining regarding ents eating meat?  I seem to

remember a single post about 2 weeks back where I casually asked if this

was going to change because of the 'tree' thing...  It was responded that

nothing about ents (fire resistance, no.axes, and no.meats) was going to

change.  Imms also explained that ents were NOT being 'changed', just a

lengthier description of what an ent really is.  They were never supposed

to be 'trees'.  I hold myself responsible for flinging this theory about

being 'da big tree' and all the stuff I said...


In other words...  Nothing really changed about ents.  Ents have been

non-meat eaters for a long time.  They just don't eat meat.  Face it. 

Ents get the advantage of better cold resistance, larger size (which

helps a LOT when tanking), and some other minor 'helpful' things...  If

ya don't like it, don't play an ent.  Especially now that people have

create food available, it shouldn't be too huge of a problem.

Odd Dilemma~
Gabriel~
If you are a light race, such as human or lizardman, and elect to become

evil, you are put into a fairly perplexing predicment.  Essentially what

occurs is you are cast out of all light race establishments and forced to

live in the dark race towns.  You aren't allowed to introduce to or group

with dark raced people, you are only allowed to group with light races. 

And if a light raced guard sees you, he kills you.  The nonsensical

situation that occurs is as follows: 


* You can't associate with Dark PCs, only Light

* You can't associate with Light NPCs, only Dark


Please rectifify this frustrating and inconsistent situation when possible.

Roleplaying~
Tystin~
Okay now this is something I wanted to talk about for a while now.  To

FORCE people into playing certin races certin ways is to me NOT role

playing.  To make characters be certin alignments is NOT roleplay.  To

make it so that certin races can not group with other races is not

roleplay.  To defind my arguments I would like just say somethings. 

First, on the Alignment thing.  I agree that 99% of all GOOD aligned

"dark races" would have been killed at birth, BUT that 1% that survived

would have left home at an early age and BAMO thay are adventures.  Okay,

I can see what the imms are talking about with the you could swing a dead

fish and hit a good aligned "darkrace" but when compared to all of the

REPOPS that happen in a day the number of good aligned "darkraces is

Quite low.  With the evil aligned "lightraces" I think that there MOTHERS

would have hidden them and protected them think that THEY would change. 

Now to touch on the Group thing.  Come on.  Give us a break.  I believe

that the Roleplaying idea for this MUD is a great thing but to impose

these restrictions on us is not roleplaying but to me ROLLplaying.  I

believe that the restrictions should be just a guide line on how one

plays their chatacter and not be FORCED to play their chracter anyone way. 

Yes I know there are ALOT of other muds out there but with all of it's

changes for good or for bad this is still the Best mud out there.

okay...I talked to much...yall have fun now.

Re: Tystin~
Mojak~
In the past, TFE did exactly what you suggest.  Guidelines were proposed

by which people should play their characters, what alignments they should

be, and who they should group with.

Know what happened? Ill tell you.


*Everyone* wanted to be Casper the friendly goblin, or Grunk the

maltempered grubby halfling.  Races were left with no sense of identity

or purpose.  In fact, being one race vs.  another had no affect

whatsoever (just about) on the way you played the game.  I beleive that

enforceing guidelines is the only way to have a coherent social model

running here.  The player base just isnt big enough to have the typical

bell-curve of everyday characters and the "exceptions".  Beleive me, I do

agree with Orb when she says we are all the Heros of our own stories, or

else we would be the village idiots or city guards just hanging around. 

However, we must be confined to some sort of continuity in order to make

our characters races/alignmtns interact in a way that makes sense.

You are in no way limited from making your character's personality unique. 

It just takes some creativity and some conscious development.

Regarding Auction.~
B'yann~
That is why auction -shouldn't- return. Peoiple get rich fast because

they can sell every cent of treasure over auction, and never have to

leave the zone.  People can just get rich and not have to worry about

popping their own gear, becase they can always buy it.  Look what

happened on the auction, with people getting rich pof recalls and krynite... 


Basically, the auction block, while good in theory, in practice isn't

much more than a way of people getting richer :p And a way for people to

get gear -beyond- their means.


Gone will be the days of people hunting because they ran out of food, or

walking home because theyt forgot to pack a recall ;) Maybe people will

learn to be better prepared, and actually have to go back to town for

reagents and food and selling gear (clearng up the zone for others to

se) once in a while.

The Legacy of the Seven Thunders (clan)~
Togashi~
Before I start, thankyou for your interest in my clan.  I am looking for

14 recruits to join my clan in the not too distant future.  The clan is

based on 7 heroes who sacrificed their lives to protect a village from an

entire army of Goblin savages.  The village was saved but not without

loss.  I recently discoved that I am the descendant of the great Crane

Thunder, Togashi Jodome.  I seek 6 leaders, to be leaders of their class,

and 6 apprentices to join them.  This clan is unique for two reasons. 

There are seven leaders, and decisions are made by these 7leaders.  The

other reason, other clans stay silent, we shall be open, we shall prove

that honor and justice is the way of things, not complete and utter chaos. 

If you wish to join mudmail me, and I consider you.  If you prove

yourself worthy I will send you a charter request.  Remember that the

ancients watch your every move, so make it an honorable one.

It could be just me, but in an RP environment, renaming someone to

You see an ogre before you with bright, twinkling sea-green eyes.  She

has long, deep mahogany colored hair that reaches all the way to the

ground but it is kept tidy by being in a plait.  She appears to be young

and lithe for an ogre and her skin is well tanned.

She is short for an ogre at only 6ft tall but she does have an

inordinately large belly.  She appears to have a wart on the back of her

hand that seems to be shaped liike a rune.

Now there is a line in my description that may imply that I am "up the

duff" Put I assure you that this is not true as I have been given the all

clear by an Imm.

re:B'yann/renaming~

I agree that naming someone 'Tobenamed' or 'Beingrenamed' while they are

thinking about a new one is not ic.  I'm sure the avatars will be glad to

think of new names for them, in their spare time, between doing twenty or

thirty approvals per day, rewriting whole descriptions, arguing with the

players that don't want to change their name from I'mgonnakillyou to

something appropriate.  Oh, and getting to actually play the game they

are here to play.  Or they could just ask a immortal to jail the player

until they come up with something.


Every effort is made to give players a chance to think of a name.  Many

are 'difficult' to put it nicely.  That is a temporary measure.

honor, and you represent your race.  I thrown down the gauntlet once more

Tousled elf, will you rise and accept, or slink back to your forest, and

kiss another tree?  The power of the Rhino doth flow quickly through my

Goblin challenges~

I believe I can speak for my elven friend when I say that not accepting a

of years of dealing with goblins, they have never shown any hints of

honor or a sense of fairness.  When goblins begin demonstrating that they

can act like a civilized race, perhaps their challenges will mean

something.  Until then, those challenges will be treated like goblins

should be treated.  They will be ignored.

Well, i'm just saying that you don't know how much work it is to create a

clan, especially as one as complex as the Merchant's Guild.  You didn't

join until it was almost completely finished, years after the creation. 

And simply put, i don't think you have the iron will that Grae did, and

the iron will of his was the only thing that made it possible.

Folks,

I'd like to sing you a song, about all MUDers' dream.

About me,

About you,

About the way our MUDy hearts glow when we kill a harmless bunny rabbit,

Maybe it's the hit points,

Maybe it's those energy points,

Maybe the compass points,

Maybe it's even the enemy's condition.

We don't know.


I'm just a regular joe,

With a regular job,

I'm yer average fighter/

Got an average staff, with an ironwood core.

My class and my race,

My clan, my packmule,

My three legged table,

A wizard called Phule.


But sometimes that just ain't enough t'keep a man like me interested,

Oh no, no way, uh uh,

No I gotta go out and have fun at someone else's expense,

Oh yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah.


I type really slow,

With an ultra fast link,

While people around me are driven to drink,

Monster Fraggin' Lag Ok?!  Med Forest, Vaasa, Dragonspire Glacier, you

can have a great big repop party and walk right into the middle of

Chiiron, but it won't make a lick of difference because you're all lagged

to hell!  Despana's not a player!  She was immor[t]al!  And as soon as we

find a way to make her a Goddess again she's gonna be pretty damn annoyed. 

Ya know why?  You ever lost a level?  Well, multiply that by fifteen

million times and that's how annoyed Despana's gonna be.  I'm gonna get

Despana, and Corwin lord of Chaos, and Irmo Grizzley-Slayer (Hey!), Scorn

('cos he's tough) and a case of Man Traps (Hey!), and ride (Hey!) down to

Chiiron (HEY!  HEY!) ...  You know?  You really are an a******!). Why

The Merchants' Guild~
Grae~
The Merchants' Guild took an incredible amount of forethought, hard work,

time, and sacrifice to set up and maintain.  Where some players devoted

time to killing mobs for levels and equipment, I devoted my time to

running TMG.  Its success was my "experience" and its expansion was my

"level".  We had established an extensive bookkeeping system which

allowed us to run a trading post, maintain a payroll + bonuses for our

members, hire and pay freelance expeditioners, and track our

earnings/losses.  It was a great organization, a strong clan, an asset to

TFE, and a hobby/learning experience for myself.  Now its gone.


I neither condone nor disapprove of Sionell's wish to bring back The

Merchants' Guild in some form.  The sudden loss of it all is just too

overwhelming to me to consider running it again.  TMG is not mine to

"give away", so anyone at all is free to initiate a similar organization

should they desire.


I appreciate the former members hard work pre-wipe, and I appreciate the

sentiment that Sionell and others obviously have for TMG.  Founding and

running the Merchants' Guild was a truly rewarding experience for me as a

player - summed up by comments from player-customers stating that coming

to the trading post to deal with Wilfred Grim was the most fun they had

had on TFE.

A joke is not funny when it degrades another person.  Please refrain from

making 'jokes' that infringe on another person's dignity.  There seems to

be a widespread problem with men around here treating us women like

sexual objects and lesser beings.


Oh, and just because someone plays a certain sex character does not mean

that person is of that gender.  I suggest using discretion with your

comments about women (or men, for that matter).


A side note: I've gotten a lot of tells in response to this, and I want

to make it clear that most of us women don't take offense to flirtation,

flattery, and other types of attention.  It's not sexual harassment if

you know your audience and they are receptive to your attention.  I'm not

even talking about sexual harassment here, that's not something I've had

much problem with.  I'm talking about men who degrade women because of

their gender by making comments, sexual in nature or otherwise.

High List~
Xendrak~
I feel the high list promotes nothing good to TFE.  It only promotes self

interest and in no way makes TFE a better place to be.  Since when is a

person jugded by a number on a list.  Everyone is only interested in

being number one and it is not hard.  All it takes to be number one is

time, there is no particular skill needed.  I know I will not be listened

to by many of you but I am just voicing my opinion.  If someone can give

me one good reason to keep it I would love to hear it.  As many of you

noticed everyone is joining in these huge groups including myself just to

get higher as fast as we can.  We should get back to the basics and start

to spread out again.  Please take this under consideration, it is just an

opinion, that is all.

little healthy competition.  We thrive on it real life, look at sports,

etc.  I think a little healthy competition is always good.  The only

reason I group with large groups is because I *really* suck soloing. 

Besides I need to level to get new spells/skills.

High List~
Jaeuhl~
My comment is simple.  In the competetive world of full pkill it was very

cool, but now it seems to go against the roleplay theme we are trying

create here.  (Finnally living up to our Yahoo description which makes me

very proud) I myself am guilty at looking at this list, and well it

rather annoys me.  I always likwd the idea of incognito excluding you

from the High List Completely but I realize this requires code and in an

already buggy situation this mud is in it just is not possible at the

moment so I agree on it being disabled.

Re: High List~

No offense Griffin, but you haven't seen what it's done to the light

groups firsthand.  It's more than the large numbers, it's the rp.  There

just isn't any.  Mad scrambles to level.  Perhaps the darks have handled

it better, which I think they have, judging by the large number of

incognito darks.  I agree with Xendrak totally.  My 2 cents.

section needs to take a step back and look at the situation.

High List vs. Roleplay~
Varro~
The only thing destroying complete and total roleplay on this mud is the

fact that you have to kill things to level.  There is no advancement for

roleplaying, besides personal satisfaction.  I've heard people say that

it's very rewarding.  If thats how you feel, roleplay.  Don't try to feed

us the line that the high list just completely FORCES you to scramble for

levels, because it doesn't.  I saw people scrambling for levels when they

took the high list out the first time.  Conclusion?  Simple, as long as

you need to hack n slash for advancement, there will be powerlevelers.  A

simple list changes nothing.  @R-Varro

them from the game.  Sound silly?  I hope so because saying one thing

should be removed from the game because it doesn't turn you on this way

or that is the same as saying we should remove another part of the game

for the same reasons.  Help files don't really help role play, maybe we

should get rid of them also.  Heh, pretty silly if you ask me that people

think we should get rid of one thing in the game because it doesn't help

role play when there are many things that also don't help role play.  So

why is this?  Because people get upset that someone they don't care for

or whatever is above them on the high list.  If you never typed high and

were only with the people that thought the same as you, you would never

know or worry about the high list.  So get with it, get over it, get it

out of your system or whatever, but I think the high list topic has been

over played just a bit.

High List~
Marik~
Many people are complaining that the high list hurts role-playing by

encouraging competition.  Perhaps it does, but that is irrelevant.  What

is relevant is that removing it will have no effect on this 'problem.'

Didn't any of you notice that people were still competing with each other

when the high list *wasn't* in?  Removing it will change nothing, it's

just a cosmetic feature for people to enjoy.  If you don't enjoy it, it's

as simple as not paying attention to it.

-

In addition, since when is competition bad role-playing?  Many people

compete in many different things, and it is far from unreasonable that

there might be say, two rival mages trying to outdo each other in power,

or two warriors trying to prove who is the bravest, or even two thieves

trying to prove who is more skilled.  These are all examples of

competition that aren't bad role-playing.  Try looking at the other side

of something before you jump to condemn it.

All this high list stuff.~
Caitria~
Okay, here is the deal.  There is no use for us to sit here and argue

with each other about what is and isn't proper roleplaying.  We're all

human on the inside and as much as we use TFE at times to get away from

who we are when we get up and leave the computer, real life feelings will

always interfere.  And the big one that seems to be rearing its ugly head

is jealousy.  People seem to like to make excuses for not being number 1

on the mud.  "Oh, I don't get powerlevelled like this person" or "I'm not

friends with the imms' morts" are ones that come out rather suddenly when

we find ourself slipping down the list.

----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- -----

Point is, some people have been around a lot longer than others and know

what needs to be done to get further up the list.  If you see this as

powerleveling, then you need to step back and realize that just one week

ago we all started at level 1.  And just remember, some people can afford

to spend more time on here than others.

----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- -----

Final thought: Don't let a number on a list with your name next to it

measure your self-worth.  Meet people, make friends, and I can assure

you the levels will start coming.

As Meina said, some roleplayers weren't liked.  Take Aeneas for example. 

He won the award for best roleplayer, was lvl 30 at the time of the wipe,

but constantly spoke about being liked by very few people.  Of course,

that was the character that he roleplayed.  So not all roleplayers are

liked by all.  Roleplaying means playing the character that you want to

play, regardless of how others feel about it.

Let's see if we can sum this up in a nutshell...  If you don't like it,

type delete (password).


The high list is a valuable tool besides finding out who is #1.  If you

are forming a group and are trying to find a mage around L15 for fireball

which might be very valuable to your group, you can use the high list to

find one.  Please also realize you must @gvoluntarily@n type 'high x' to

find out what level people are.  If you don't want to compete with

someone, don't look at the high list.  Competition is good, it drives the

human psyche.  Even when the high list was gone, competition was still

there in full force.  If you feel someone is playing purely to be #1, and

you want to roleplay...  @RDon't group with them!@n 


@bWhy is it that when someone doesn't like something, they try to force

its removal on everybody else?  Just because you don't like it, doesn't

mean it's gonna send everybody else to hell because they happen to like

it.@n 


Re: Light-race roleplay.  Yup, overall it sucks right now.  I played the

first week here as a light race tank, and boy did I see some horrendous

RP from my light-race group members.  Then again, a good portion of the

light race people seem to be relatively new to TFE, RP'ing, and also

chose new race/class.


Then again, if you feel someone isn't RP'ing to your beliefs, then don't

group with them.  I didn't like the attitudes and performance on the

light race side, so I went dark.  As simple as that.


Re: darks being bigger in general...  Take the login hours of Griffin,

Lani, Haart, etc.  and compare them to most of the light race people. 

Take the experience they have in their type of characters...  Gee,

Griffin was a tank, is now a tank.  Lani was a cleric, is now a cleric... 

Like there's a huge suprise that they're bigger.  Most of the light-race

people I've seen are playing a totally new race/class, don't put in a lot

of hours, or just plain suck.


Re: RP...  Everybody has a different way to RP.  If you fully RP, expect

to either hate or be hated by a good portion of the MUD.  Not everybody's

going to click with your personality.  Face it folks.  And there is no

such thing as 'perfect RP'.  Everybody's own style is perfect for

themself.  Drop the RP argument folks, you'll never get anywhere as long

as you have the attitude that your way of RP'ing or thoughts about RP is

the best way for everybody.  Just do your own thing, and you'll be a

better person for it.  Don't go policing everybody else's actions,

because it's not your job.

What you are claiming is a lie dreaming up by your treacherous people to

hide the fact that you cannot be trusted!  You lie to the humans and

tell them that the true vyans are the evil ones, but we know the truth,

History~
Malayne~
History, that monolith we rely so heavily on as 'the truth', is a

creation, slanted and twisted by the one who records it.  And the

recorded history here is so limited, so general, that each of us must

fill in the gaps with information we acquire personally.  How you can

condemn a person for his knowledge of history is beyond me, when you know

nothing of his culture, personal experience, or beliefs.


As for vyan history, we do concede that we came from the same roots as

the elves.  However, our interpretation is that the strongest of the race

became vyan while the weak members became the elves.  The weak elves, of

course, hold different beliefs.  So be it.

There is a history being written for TFE, and it tries to be as objective

as possible.  When it is finished, (and it should take quite a bit of

time, because our history daemons are rushing to find the rare books and

scrolls left over from different eras and compile them into a legible

history) - many of you will have an understandable history to go on,

although of course you will see it your way.

Hypocrites~
Marsel~
(ooc) it saddens me to see this, but I it has to be said, despite the

silly replies that will probably be sent back as a result.  Ok, let me

explain to you what many of you are good at doing here.  I don't care

which race you are, this is what you do.  You sit in one area with thirty

of your friends, powerleveling until the sun don't shine, and then on and

on until the shine does shine, and then on and on, etc.  Then you find

yourself level 20, or 30, and you see this high list number, which of

course means you have more experience than this other guy.  Then you

decide to have a four second 'roleplay' trip, and start talking on the

gossips or noteboards like you are the greatest thing in the world.  And

you say, "I kill you elf" or "die, troll" and ask them to meet you in the

arena.  You of course are doing nothing more than being a total

hypocrite, because anyone who is probably really roleplaying is level 4

still, because they refuse(as Malissin stated earlier) the pleasures of

powerleveling.  SO, next time any of you decide to be stupid and fume

your mouth on the noteboards, think about that.  As for those who don't

do that sort of thing, kudos to them.  I couldn't be happier for them. 

But it happens all too often that you people think you're so cool because

you can do that.  And to the RP'ers: Of course you're jealous of the fact

that you actually play your character instead of those horrible people

who powerlevel.  Don't blink, for most of you it's true, you're a bit

jealous.  And I doubt much is gonna be done about it.  Just enjoy

yourselves.  All of you enjoy yourselves.  Because the fact of the matter

is, this is supposed to be a pleasurable experience for most everyone.

Someone brought up a good point...~
Griffin~
I'd just like to say one thing....


Before the wipe, the 'generalized' definition of powerlevelling was a

60th (or really high level tank) bringing along a couple of newbies to

suck xp that didn't really help the group.

People complained and the rp'rs posted many a note...


Now, there was a wipe, and we all had to start at level 1 again, and the

rp'rs are starting up with the 'powerlevelling' bit again.


First, let's define what powerlevelling is...

Its NOT a bunch of people (no matter how big the group is) getting

together and taking bigger mobs than they should be.


What powerlevelling is, is a high level person levelling someone who

levels so fast they don't get the full enjoyment of the game, they don't

get the right amount of pracs/improves to have the skills they need at

certain levels.


Just because someone knows how to level faster than you doesn't meant

that they are a bad person, or haven't got what they want from the game.

History as best as it can be~
Deaghaidh~
Elven History?  My true name is Sidhe, though this name I now carry was

gifted to me for faithful service by Dawnstar, who I faithfully and

humbily serve.  The Elven history is an important one and I believe it is

one that must be preserved.  It is by strange fate that I found myself

the Historian of the elves, through circumstances I wish not to explain. 

I am perhaps the eldest elf in existence, much older than most who look

thousand times my appearance.  Of course there may be a few older, either

way my age and my upbringing gifted me with Elven history, before the

fall of the Leigh dynasty and before the anarachaic ways that now reign

through the vaasa.  Thus the tales I heard were fairly accurate as they

had been passed down with accuracy in mind, as Llewyrr tend to be annoyed

by any kind of factual error, lies are just not our way.  Whats more some

of the more recent history (specifically the fall of the leigh dynasty

and the re-formation of the Shuvanaguard) I have witnessed with my own

eyes.  Thus I have done my best to compile the words of the scholars who

taught me of my history as a boy, and in many areas Talis, Holy Messenger

of Dawnstar has answered many many questions (to the point that I fear I

may have been a bit of a nuisance) to try and compile the most accurate

source of llewyrr history in existence.  Even now I seek artifacts of

history to better complete the whole picture.  Just recently I've been

uncovering many bits about the Llewyrr's war with the Humans.  I have

tried to give all races an objective view point (something not easily

done since many of even the greatest historians have given other races an

opinionated slant) and I have no hatred for any race, including vyan. 

Hatred nor Vengence is not mine to give and if anything I pity the vyan

who now live marked for mistakes their ancestors made.  If you wish to

hear the history I have compiled, seek me out, I promise I do not have

all the answers but I will share what I know.


OOC as noted I have done my best to get the real history of elves in the

TFE world.  This is not based on any other role play game.  Instead I

read just about every story on the story board, both elves and non- elves. 

(though this was some time ago) and did my best to build a history that

would not only work into everyones stories, but would enhance them.  I

even asked many people from all different races questions on their

viewpoint on elven history and drew the best...  culmination of everyones

ideas and beliefs that I could (making the history quite broad and room

for LOTS of detailed growth per player).  My aim was not to tear down

roleplay but to give elves and other related races a solid platform to

build from.  Whats more I have asked Talis just about everything that

could be asked about elven history and he has been beyond helpful.  Of

course you don't have to subscribe to this history I wouldn't force such

a thing and it would not be hard to write a way out of this history, for

my goal is to ENHANCE roleplay not ENFORCE it.


If you want a copy of the time line or any other info on elven history

feel free to mail me, tell me, or seek me and I will do my best to help,

I'm not ashamed at all to say I don't know, in fact i think it adds to

the reality of the history, after all we don't know everything about our

own history in the real world.

I know I sent a note earlier, but thats about 100notes lower down on the

board.  As you may or may not know, I'm in the process of making a new

clan.  This clan will be different from all the other clans at present. 

Let me explain.  My clan will be based on 7heroes, of a forgotten past,

who died to save Kha-da.  My clan will be based on these 7 heroes.  Each

hero will be a different thunder.  For starters each member will be given

a title.  For example the Warrior Thunder, will be called the Great Lion

thunder, you get the idea?  Also the clan will be completely open, so you

will know what the clan is up to.  We intend to fund archery contests

(not sure what the imms think) and various other ideas, if you are

interested, send a mudmail to Togashi.  If I consider you worthy, you

will be sent a charter.


Remember, the ancients are watching you, you cannot ignore your destiny forever......

Vaasa groups~

I'm interested in finding people interested in forming groups in the

Vaasa, and maybe the occasional foray out of it.  I tried getting into

several groups outside the Vaasa, but found healers in low demand and was

often outright ignored despite my every attempt to ask in character,

politely and realisticly.  (ie I didn't just walk up and send tells

saying "U wanna grp?") 


Something even more dismaying was watching extremely unlike groups

working together.  The evil vyan grouping with the good elves who had an

ent tank just didn't make sense at all.  Since I am an ent, and

theoretically come from the Vaasa, and I know a few areas here or nearby

where I can comfortably level for a while, I'd like to encourage other

ents and elves who live in the Vaasa to socialize a bit more and perhaps

we can get a few Vaasa groups started.  :)

Elves.~
Denzar~
My scholarly studies into vyan history has revealed startling revelations

to me.  I am convinced more and more each day that it is the elves who

betrayed the vyans, and not the other way around, as the elves lie.


My belief in this comes from the elven name, "Llewyrr."


A study of this word reveals it has a similar base to our word, "Lower",

giving indication that the vyans named the elves as such.  This is

clearly evident when one notes that the elves are a lower breed than are

the vyans.


This leads me to assume that the elves are a breakaway race from the

vyans, and not the other way around, as their propoganda masters have

fabricated.  This must be true, since the elven name for themselves has

vyan origins.


I will reveal more as more is revealed to me.

I noticed monks are the suckiest class here.  Their cirts hardly do any

can do significant;y more damage than them.  I typed help Monks, and it

said monks were extremely deadly fighters and infliceted massive damage. 

I rest my case.  And my whining :)

As with all classes, monks take time to develop and to become deadly

are the better they are.  Perhaps you just need to get your skills up.


Oh, and I agree with Rue.


Most of the fun of playing a character here is developing it.  Improving

skills/spells to max levels, learning one skill to a level that allows

you to learn another..  The difficulty level of this mud, makes each

skill improve or practice something to really appreciate..and nothing is

handed to you.  You must go out and earn it.

they all have low hp and receive low exp and have many spells.

 the only problem is  a pal,mage receive the same spells, i admit

that they receive them at higher levels but they also gain those levels faster then a cleric

finally a cleric will heal causing him to miss the battle and lose exp

so why not delete all clerics since everyone has cleric in them.


***

If you don't like clerics, don't play them.  There are plenty that find

it a rewarding class.

And as a general comment: We have spent a LOT of time making each class

enjoyable if it is played the way it is designed.  If you don't like a

class, you probably should play one that fits your style better.

re:clerics~
Marik~
Not everyone has cleric in them.  I don't know what crack you're smoking,

but it's clouded your brain kiddo.  There are 3 classes with healing

magics.  Rangers, whose healing magic is weak as a whole, either by plain

effectiveness or time required to cast.  There's the paladin, who gets

some good healing spells to be sure.  At level 7 they get cure light,

which is great -at those lower levels.  By the time you get to level 30,

trust me, you're sick to death of it.  At level 30 you get cure serious,

which you live with for what is it now, 50 more levels?  On top of that,

paladin's have suffered a rather large reduction in hitpoints.  Judging

by the hits that my paladin received, it would take a paladin with about

17-18 constitution nowadays to get what he had at a 14 con.  Lastly,

there's the cleric.  They are a royal pain in the butt to get to level

15, to be sure...  if, of course, we were at the point we reached before

the pwipe.  Since everyone is still relatively low level, you can get a

cleric a few levels and get into a gremlins group in a snap.  However,

clerics get cure serious at leevl 15, at which point they become in high

demand, and can even find some decent groups when there aren't as many

people at this early stage, and at level 25 onwards, as long as they

prove themselves reliable, they are almost never lacking for a group.  To

top it off, clerics are never required to start tanking if they want to

get into a group.  A paladin or a ranger, if there isn't anyone on who

can tank what they want to run, will have to organize the group and lead

it through the zone.  This is something that gets old quickly.  The

advantage to a paladin is that they can serve as a support healer,

protecting from area attacks.  As a paladin I spent most of my healing

time keeping group members alive.  I was *never* a substitute for a

cleric.

(what an ugly looking block of text.. I hope you sifted through it ok)

**

Now don't get me wrong.  I like paladins, I'm not complaining about them,

or about rangers.  but remember this - every class has something they are

good at, and while other classes may be able to do similar things, No

other class will be better at it.

On a side note..  what could have possibly deluded you into thinking that

mages and clerics get the same spells?

re: Surtur~
Fingolfin~
Oh sure.  Monks suck.  Well, for your information, I never saw anyone

inflict more damage per round then a monk.  And I used to play a

character for 42 levels here, so I know a thing or two.  Only thieves do

more damage with assasinate, but they can do that one time per fight,

while monks get crits all the time, if crit hit is high enough. 

Actually, come to think of it, the imms had to change the damage specter

beacuse Jago did only annihilates with critical hit.  So believe me when

I say, monks are no pansies or wussies.  If you want to play a fun

character who does *massive* damage, play a monk.

Hello all, I will be away from home for a couple of weeks, and generally

find a monochrome Wyse terminal or four that I can telnet away at happily

until local 9 PM.  Yes, I had to jup (jump) thou (thru) some hoops to get

Regarding revised item wear positions~
Ganelon~
This may sound like a whine.  It isn't intended to be, but take it as you

will.  I just customed a duckfeather charm.  Granted this isn't the most

awesome of items on the mud, but it always seemed a nice little bonus for

newbies killing in the pond.  However, when I try it on, I discover that

it now wears in the same spot as a shell necklace.


Now, I'm not bothered by the reduction of items that can be worn at the

same time nor that items have changed from before pwipe.  I also

understand that items are probably still being revised.  There are 2

things I am concerned about, however.  First, an item likely to be

customed by new players will now more likely be a source of

disappointment than anything else.  The other is an as yet unverified

concern that, in the effort to redesign wear locations, many items will

fade out of use.


I like decisions about what to wear to be hard.  I want to see characters

wearing different equipment sets not because they haven't the popped the

supperior item X yet, but because they have a different opinion on which

is the better item among many reasonable choices.  At least with shell

necklaces and duckfeather charms, I don't see this happening.

PROFANITY~
Arioch~
I don't care where you're from, or how you were raised, proper

internet protocol on MUD's MUSH's MOO's Chat rooms, common

curtesy is not to use profanity.  If you use it with 'to' or 'tell'

you can say what you want, but in groups, channels, or yelling,

it is immoral and unethical.  Please refrain from using this type

of language.  TFE's policy on this is not to use profanity,

see HELP POLICIES for this, if you don't believe me.


Arioch

@G

Would just like to add my two cents.  The Immortals aren't baby sitters,

but if a player repeatedly harasses someone with profanity _even_ on tell

or to, that player will be dealt with.  The mud is here for _everyone's_

enjoyment, not as an arena of vulgarity.  As such, think before you speak

and find other ways to express yourself _without_ profanity if you feel

the extent of your emotions must be forced upon someone for whatever

reason :p

Re: Clerics and cause light~

Another agreement with Griffin.  Matter of fact I have a little story. 

Manik and I were in the trogs, and I attacked a mob which destroyed my

weapon.  Had it not been for Manik's casting cause light, I would have

been toast.

I also agree with Griffin in that if you die because one cleric wasn't

casting cures for the first couple rounds cause he cast cause light, you

should either get more clerics, or stop tanking those mobs.

Trust your cleric, he's your friend. :)

Re: Clerics~

Why all the emphasis on healing/causing damage?  Yeah, it's something

clerics can do great, but I've always appreciated having bless and holy

wrath cast on me.  Yeah, it means finding a cleric of similar or same

alignment as me, but that's part of the fun of being a tank with 6

clerics (and a mage) following me.  (Just so's y'all know, that was

before the pwipe...  now I can't seem to attract a cleric no matter how

big the bribe)

896989332
re:Griffin~
Fleur~
*gasp* Once again I find myself in complete agreement with Griffin.  If

you die before a cleric can get off a cause light, you have no business

tanking the zone you're trying to tank.


I, for one, am and was a cleric that used cause light because I chose not

to wear +hit and +dam gear, but rather to keep my regen gear on at all

times.  It helped the group, helped run areas faster and as a result the

whole group spent less time sleeping.  I think my reputation as a healer

speaks for itself in this case and I can't remember ever losing a tank

because I cast cause light at the start of a battle.


While we're on the subject of clerics..I would like to add here that the

tank that thinks a cleric is only good for healing is most assuredly

missing the boat and not taking advantage of the other, extremely helpful

spells a cleric can cast in battle to aid the 'cause'.

grouping~
Pulchit~
I've heard recently some complaints about 'filtering' people out of

groups or having 'cliques' that are favored for grouping.  I realize that

in/out groups are inherent in (OOC) human social interaction, but I hope

that people will try to realize that when people are snubbed and excluded

it causes nothing but grudges and really annoying behavior.  I'm not

trying to preach, but I am hopin that the fine skill of being polite

hasn't been completely lost.

----------------------------------

If someone asks me to group with them and I am busy or unable to join, I

usually attempt to explain why and promise to group with them in the

future.

If I'm leading or in a group and someone wants to join, I will forward

the request to the tank or sincerely consider the request within the

framework of group response.

If I want to group with someone, I _hope_ that they and their group will

give me (and anyone else) the basic consideration that people deserve as

human beings.

This does not mean automatically group anyone who asks, but treat them as

if they were people with feelings.  Give them a response, at the least.

...

And in the case that someone makes a complete ass of themselves and gets

themselves on your chiznit list, ignore them for a while until they get

the point and try and give them a second chance.

Please feel free to reply to this or send me tells.

Reality Check!~
Atrax~
Re: Pulchit's note


Coming from a long-time tank, you just aren't going to see that perfect

world people dream up where nobody solo's unless they have to, and all

people gain huge experience while nobody dies and everybody gets along

like little care bears.


(1) Groups can only be a certain size before they become 'too big'. 

People get spammed, most people don't hit, and people usually become rude

and tell everybody to shut up so they can do anything.  Groups this size

are an abomination.  If you can't have casual conversation freely, you

shouldn't be there.  Most of the time half the group is 10% of the size

of the tank, so their presence is just there to 'scratch' the mob once

and powerlevel.


(2) Sometimes personalities just don't click.  The main reason I play

here is to have fun.  If I'm not having fun, I log off for a while.  If

I'm not having fun for a few consecutive logins, I play an alt.  If I'm

not having fun with any of my characters, I take a break away for a while. 

Fun is #1.  Forcing someone I don't like (or someone else doesn't like)

is not a priority at all.  Groups should have casual and IC conversations

flowing freely.  If you don't get along with someone in a group, you

shouldn't be there unless as a 'favor' to someone else who needs you.


(3) Some people just plain SUCK at what they do.  If a cleric can't heal

properly, I die, and most of the group can too.  If a mage casts on a

sleeping mob or on the dwarven captain after I told everybody 3 times not

to, they're an idiot.  I refuse to die because someone in my group is

incompetent.  Fun is #1, and dying sure isn't fun.


(4) I realize most of Pulchit's post was 'courtesy in responding to

people who ask to group.'...  I wish some people could see the # of tells

I receive in an average login.  I get about 5-10 people saying hello

(thanks!), and about 5-10 tells asking if I'm gonna tank something, etc. 

even if I've only been online 5 seconds.  I used to receive about 100

tells per login from people asking if I'm tanking something, if I'm gonna

tank something, if I'd tank something for them, or if they could just

plain join.  Half these people I don't even know, but must've intro'd in

a fit of idiocy.  Please realize...  I have lots of friends here, which I

like very much.  Most of these people I enjoy hearing from.  Either I

don't know they're online, or they're a good source of info to form

something up.  But I get tells from people who were 10% my size asking if

they could join up solely because I'm someone who tanks frequently.  I

cannot always be nice to every newbie who asks to join me.  When I am

tanking, my attention is on the group.  Sometimes I do not respond, and

sometimes I just plain tell people to go away.  When you're being spammed

by someone in the middle of killing, courtesy comes last.


(5) Most of the time, if a tank wanted to tank something, he'd be forming

it up already.  Don't be offended if a tank does not invite you into a

group.  Their group might already be too full, someone doesn't like you

so the tank doesn't want conflict, or a multitude of other innocent

reasons.  Ask over a public channel if someone can use your talents, and

if someone invites you then good.  Don't whine just because a tank

doesn't drag you everyplace from the second you get online to the moment

you leave.


Remember, tanks are people too.  The limelight a tank receives puts a lot

of stress on them.  I receive a ton of tells every day asking about

grouping, areas, equipment, money, powerleveling, etc.  I can't handle

every question with the tact and grace I might want, so don't be offended

if a tank isn't 'miss manners' with you on every question you ask.

and rp or not, its still frowned upon by immortals.  So, I would suggest

you be more selective in what you call rp and refrain from such behavior. 

No one, light or dark, wants to spend much time with someone with that

reputation.  You might find yourself scrounging for groups.

re:bwithh/raltin~
Ashke~
Erainn is totally right.  I would also like to point out you said _if_ it

was a pk zone.  Immortals have clearly said actions in a pk zone and

non-pk zone aren't just differed by the ability to kill one another.  So

justifying 'roleplaying' to counter 'kill stealing' is clearly

un-acceptable.  If you see somebody clearly killing the mad villager,

mage in warrens, or wherever, it is obvious they want an item, so it

_would_ be rude to just take the item and leave them the kill.

RE:  Atrax~
Pulchit~
I agree with your note almost entirely.  I am glad that someone deigned

to respond to my concerns!  :) The primary purpose of my note was to

bring to the public view the issue of blatant discrimination, and the

hope that people can be polite.  Being polite is a two edged sword.  It

is difficult to respect others when they are spamming you, true.  But it

is also very necessary to give people a chance, which I think was my main

point.  I didn't expect people to actually change how they formed groups,

I just was trying to improve communication between people, that's all.

Like I said before, if I ask someone to group with them and they say,

"No, we're full but thanks for asking..." I'll take that pretty well! 

The important thing is that they recognized that I existed and took the

time to respond, rather than comopletely ignoring my request.

thanks for the response!

Important Information~
Demok~
Repetetive Death Syndrome, or RDS, strikes an estimated thirty players a

day.  RDS strikes when one least expects it, and there are no early

warning symptoms.  If you see someone afflicted with RDS, invite them

into your group, give them something helpful, or even just a hug will be

guaranteed to help them with their RDS.  Those afflicted with RDS have

been known to die multiple times in a single day, sometimes reaching

double-digit proportions, this is no laughing matter.  Remember, RDS can

strike anyone, even you, so be careful.  Unless you're an elf.

Just wanted to congratulate the imms who worked on the lowbie areas

during the downtime (being that these are the areas I've seen).  While

most players pass through these places without little regard for the room

descs, trying to get to a high enough level to be picked by one of the

self-proclaimed tanks for a group, it is really wonderful to see alot of

effort go into making them realistic and wonderfully described.  Areas

like ants and the Chiiron graveyard really do jump out at you and have

progressed so far away from the image of generic "these are necessary for

any mud" areas.  Turn option brief on if you have to, but take the time

at least the first time through to reread the descs in an area, try to

feel what the builders/rebuilders were feeling and don't just memorize a

block/room layout.

Don't tell me how to play my character~
Plagad~
Why can't I intro to an elf?

Is it because I'm supposed to be a mean old troll?

So all trolls are mean?

There isn't a friendly troll in the universe?

Is it because others before me have decided to create a group of elves,

vyans, orcs and dwarves, kill some elves and orcish raider while talking

about french fries?

I am trying to roleplay a stupid dumb troll.  My troll doesn't care about

politics.  His instincts are very basic.  Get food-get shinies.  He

doesn't think-As I remember my trollish lifestyle would make it so I

should kill elves on sight because of complex racial relations.  (in

british accent) He would rather frolic and eat then growl and spit.  You

don't have to intro me if you don't want to.  You can spam me with spits,

growls and taunts.  Your choice.  And if you did I might think -This be

bad.  No body here like me.  Bad place, no go here again.  Or I could

think -He be mean.  Teach him BIG lesson!  Nice shiny sword!  Also what

the deal with this- Ogres shopkeepers live in Medienne but ogre PCs won't

associate with humans.

classes.~
Fleur~
I would like to congratulate the imms here on the work they have done

balancing the mud.  Not..  Paladins are virutually impossible to play,

with reduced hps and manna..  comparing 17 con warrior to 17 con paladin.. 

warrior gets 22hps per level, the paladin 12?  Give me a break..  and

reduced manna for paladins too.  4 or 5 per level..  and don't tell me

that 10 intel is insufficient.  The 4/5 per level is halved from

pre-pwipe..  Oh, and this is another good one.  Clerics, who are the

single hardest class to play and level, now get less manna per level and

mages..  the most powerful class get more?


This manna information provided by an immortal. How nice.


I just want to know when some balance is going to be restored to this

game.  Oh..  if you don't believe its unbalanced look at the number of

monks/mages vs.  paladins..  and then ask them all what they played

pre-pwipe.



While we're on the subject of clerics, I would really like to know what

possible logic there could have been in moving cure serious to level 15. 

Was it to slow down the powerlevelers?  I use that term for lack of a

better one.  It only made it harder for those of us that like small

groups to run anything other the same areas for levels and levels and

levels more.


Oh yes..  and mages now get more hps per level than they used to, plus

vitality which is +30 hps.  Clerics seem to be unchanged but the vote is

still notin on that one.


So, in conclusion, if you call this a balanced mud, I would really

appreciate an immortal sitting down with me and explaining just what they

are basing their conclusion on.


Fleur


PS Don't waste your breath flaming me on the boards folks.  I don't read

flames.


Warriors average 14 + con bonus and Paladins average 12 + con bonus.

So 2 hp difference per level on average if equal con.

One paladin was getting 12 hps per level after con bonus.

Choosing a Class~
Liana~
What I would guess the problem many of us have is that the class that

matches our adventuring, our fighting style is rarely the same one that

fits our role-playing style, the 'vision' we have for our character.


I don't think this problem is going anywhere, unless we are willing to

resign ourselves to a world where the differences between professions are

only cosmetic, and there are plenty of other muds out there if that's

what we're looking for.

The Ents~
Luxus~
The name ent was first used by J.R.R.  Tolkien in his Lord of the Rings

trilogy, in the second part: Two Towers.  In the book, two hobbits meet

Fangorn, or Treebeard, an ent leader, and he leads them to the Entmoot,

or gathering of the ents.  In that work of fiction, ents are described as

tall, _tree-like_, with braks as skin, unbendable joints, branch like

limbs, and they even speak and think very slowly, as well as being able

to become more like trees with the passing the time.  Some even do

*become* trees in the end.  Of course, that is how J.R.R.  Tolkien

describes the ents.


Far be it for me to *proscribe* what ents should be like, I just

want to point out what their inventor made them like.

I could be wrong, ents could be made from another mythical being,

but I am pretty sure there aren't any in European mythology.


This post just so you know the background when you bicker

about ents and approvals. Have fun bickering... ;-)

had already dug the floor.  already dug the floor.

I always thought if a pebble is sitting in the road, and someone is

killing a rabbit, if someone walking through gets the pebble first, it is

thiers.  And I would hardly think it wrong of against all, a vyan, who if

I met in a pkill zone would put out of thief misery anyways.

sleeping next to a room with aggro mobs other people have walked in and

killed the mobs.  Even at times when it is very apparent that I am

planning on taking the mob, such as in the thieves in Voaleth caverns. 

While this may not technically be kill stealing, it is very rude and

reproachable behavior.

Re:Gaines and Kill stealing~
Geriden~
Rue posted a note recently regarding what is and is not considered kill

stealing.  Things like waiting until combat is over then taking someone

else's skin, that's blatant.  Attacking a mob someone else is fighting,

again, blatant.  But what about the rest?

When you are sitting in a room with a mob, eating or regenning or casting

a spell, or if you're sitting at the entrance to a room with only one

exit...  that seems pretty damned obvious to me the person is going to

kill the mob.  A long time ago something like that would have been easily

considered kill stealing, when rules were enforced.  Now, after a pwipe,

while everyone is impractically huddled together in the same areas, these

things are more vaguely defined.

It is _not_ just the people who are using RP as an excuse, they are easy

to see through.  Most kill stealers simply walk up to the mob you're

considering, kill it, skin it, then walk away as if you were there

specifically to watch them.  They don't even say a word, because they

have nothing to fear.  They were told on the noteboard that they can't be

prosecuted in the "spirit" of the rule, only the very narrowly placed

letters.  "The mob wasn't fighting." This is the reason mudders are

despised and considered petulant greedy children all across the internet

and across all the other types of MU's.  Please imms, define the rules a

little better, make guidelines that rely on common sense and enforce them.


This is not a tough issue.  This is not a mind-boggling debate.  It's not

all that tough to realize that someone reached the mob first, and at the

very least you can ask them what their intentions are.  Anyone who is too

dumb to figure it out deserves the results of the enforcing.

Clerical Oath.~
Karzat~
Attention, all clerics, great and small!


Due to the growing number of clerics in the land, I have created a

clerical oath that all clerics must swear by in order to fulfill their

clerical duties.  This is to provide unity to clerics everywhere and to

properly prepare all tanks for what power we hold.


@CI.@n I resolve to lose link at least once a fight, even if my lag is

non-existent.  A nervous tank is a tank on his toes.


@CII.@n I resolve to only log on when I am in a foul mood.  I will always

remember that I am a cleric, and my temper tantrums can make or break a

group.  This being the case, I will engage in a childish tantrum at least

once a day, just to prove how important I am.


@CIII.@n I won't bother logging on if I am not lagging.  Lag will

properly hide any incompetence I may have.


@CIV.@n I will never carry sacramental oil with me.  If someone hands it

to me, and they are evil, then I am neutral.  If they are neutral, then I

am good.  If they are good, then I lose link.


@CV.@n I will advise other clerics in my groups to conserve their cures. 

If the tank dies, then I was lagging.


@CVI.@n Cause light is my friend.  I will cast it multiple times a fight

in case I lose link and don't get a chance to cast it.  If the tank dies,

I will blame my ZMud.


@CVII.@n I can always get groups.  Death doesn't hurt me.  I will ensure

that I accidently flee and die in an aggresive zone where I am the only

one with summon.  If the group asks for a summon out, I will lose link.


@CVIII.@n I will follow someone else to any group I join.  When I get to

the new group, I will forget to change my cure aliases.  If accused of

incompetence, I will blame my ZMud.


@CIX.@n I am a cleric.  I am better than you are.

RE: Kezef on the ideas board~
Hoel~
Not wanting to start a huge spam, after reading kezef's not I felt I had

to agree.  I understand the reason for making the higher-level skills

hard to gain, yet I feel that there are other ways to do it, rather than

invisible hidden entrances and riddles.  The quest idea is good, I would

suggest something like the elven longsword quest, where you can only gain

your reward after doing every step of the quest, wheither you know it

already or not.  This would add to the fun of gaining new skills/spells

and also avoid the biggest trap the current method will face, the fact

that people will not be willing to engage on a 'pointless' search when it

is simpler to ask someon.


Consider this; ask yourself would you rather spend several hours engaged

on what may be a fruitless search, or just ask someone who happens to

have that skill/spell already?  If you answer that question honestly, you

will probably get the same answer as 99% of the people here.  One final

thing, there is *NO* way you can stop the spreading of this information

happenening, except on public channels.  Therefore, if you wish to keep

this chalenging, and I applaud that idea, I feel it may be worth

considering Kezef's idea.  Remember, the 'leak' of information has

happened before, how else do you think so many people knew of the more

exotic teachers in the pre-pwipe days?

Revoltin' developments~
Murchad~
Some things have gotten a bit unsettling.  To make sure we fully

understand the issue we must clearly distinguish between *player* stats

and *character* stats.  Blurring these two is a troubling development.

Take for instance a character's intelligence.  This is a statistic, chose

at chargen, and it's fully understandable for things like spell

effectiveness or understanding runes to hinge upon this figure.  But the

cut-back on giving IC information OOCly and the absence of the auction

block have seen a dramatic and disquieting rise in the MRIQ (minimum

required IQ for the layperson).  I was just told that I now have to

actually walk all the way to another town to meet someone and exchange my

item, because I can't simply *flutters fingers* send it over to him/her

by magic.

Well now that just stinks.

Do you realize you cannot, at the moment, equip yourself as a level 2-3

newbie with scale equip and +2 swords for the price of a few goat skins

and a rabbit's foot?  I mean..  come *on* imms, what's going on?  The

other day I had to *drop* some equip because it was too heavy.  Sheeyeah

like that's realistic.  Well...  so maybe it is, a little, but I mean

what's the point of having mobs pop all this good stuff if I can't stuff

it in a bag and hand it to a demon to carry if halfway across the world

for the price of a silver piece?  Right?

Don't get me wrong, I was getting a little worried for a while about this

"RP" thing I heard about.  But there's still the wanted board, and we got

the high list back, so that must have all been another practical joke. 

*whew* not funny, don't do that again.  :( But what's what the info stuff? 

And having to find things for yourself?  Need I remind you there are

people here who were leveled from 1-20 without every knowing how to get

from chiiron to Medienne.  And they have to find trainers?  It's called

discrimination.

I just hope this isn't a lasting trend.  :( I mean, what's next, getting

thrown out of town because you killed a citizen?  Being held accountable

for your actions?  Having to do a quest for a certain item? 

Phthlphlphths!

Seriously, imms, with all the great logic I've collected off the boards

and from the mouths of the average ride-the-waves player and put here, in

this note, doesn't it sound so much better to throw in those shortcuts?

Area Abuse~
Nepthys~
It's been said before, but I guess is has to be said again.  There are

too many players right now who either don't understand, or simply don't

care about sharing an area with fellow players.  I have been the

unfortunatel witness of dozens of incidents where I have been waiting in

the next room, preparing to attack a mob, and someone races by me,

showing off their T3 connection, kills the mob, races back to kill other

"important" mobs, and by the time half an hour has passed, I've hardly

got a blow in.  I'm getting very tired of this.  If you see someone in

the room right next to the mob, YOU SHOULD ASK whether they are going to

attack it, then make an agreement to alternate.  I'm not going to name

names, but I know of at least 4 players who are serious abusers of this

rule, and if it keeps up then I guess I'll have to do something which I

abhor, namely, inform the Imms about it.

re: Nepthys~
Gaines~
I agree completely with Nepthys, as I have been the victim of such

behavior on more than one occassion.  What makes this situation so sad is

that these individuals do this all in the name of roleplaying.  These

individuals feel that it is within the scope of their characters

personality to do what basically amounts to stealing kills.  I really

hope that the IMMs step in to do something about this, since it appears

that the players themselves have no intention of stopping.  It is sad,

though, that some players can't see the difference between roleplaying

and being inconsiderate of the thoughts and feelings of other players. 

These few players are making the game unenjoyable for a great many.

I hope and pray that something is done to remedy this situation.

I was asked nicely to change mine before when it was close to someone's,

I doubt any hard coded regulations preventing name similarity would be

seems to be a rather low coding priority.  If you have a specific

complaint, let an Avatar know and he/she can probably look into it.


Of course you realize that in rl people have similar names all the time

and even the same name.  Confusion can and does happen, as it should.  I

see nothing wrong with it unless the name in question is a direct mockery

of a name.

Temporary fix...~
Murchad~
Until Reputations are redone, if reputations are redone, could we go back

mobs attack dark races on sight and likewise for dark raced guards, until

such a time as one's actions can determine where they can go and how

welcome they will be.

With all due respect and admiration to the fine work done post-wipe, it's

disheartening to see more vyans walking around in Chiiron than there are

in Voaleth, and this isn't the fresh start "with an emphasis on

Role-Play" that many envisioned when the announcement was made.  Thanks.

Fellow Mudders~
Kierthos~
Recently, on the ooc channel, I asked someone to watch their language, as

I am prone to do in a Freudian way whenever I see someone swear on a

public channel.  This immediately started a conversation on who should

enforce the rules of Forest's Edge.  One viewpoint was that is the

responsibility of the Immortals, and only them, to enforce the rules.  I

however, disagree with this.  I realize that there are some rules

infractions (bug abuse) that only Immortals can deal with properly, but

frankly, I'd rather see the Immortals having time to work on coding and

building rather then have to deal with every little thing that comes

along.


Now, since I have also been accused of attempting to bring every little

problem to the attention of the Immortals, I feel I must explain my

actions.  When I, as Joe Player give someone a warning, it is just that. 

It carries no force, no threat of repercussions should their actions

continue, and no, I will not tattle to the Immortals at the next

opportunity.


But when I give someone a warning about something, whether it is swearing

on a public channel, kill stealing, or whatever, it is notifying them

that they are breaking the established rules of Forest's Edge.  They are

now aware of this.  They cannot claim ignorance later.

Re:Kierthos~

I just wanted to show my support for Kierthos in writing.  I'm the exact

same way - if you break the rules and I see you - out of sheer force of

habit, I'll tell you.


I'm usually really lax on everything with the exception of swearing on

Public channels.  I realize that there are times when you want to, out of

aggrivation, list a long line of explitives to let the whole MUD know

your problems.  However, I know of at least a handful of 13 year olds who

play TFE and while young people these days know WAY more curse words then

I (at the ripe old age of 22), that doesn't make using them in public

right.  We need to set an example, as scary a concept as that may be for

most of us.

Re: Lorah~
Luxus~
I wish to add my few ents to the discussion on swearing on public

channels.  Just because you come from a conservative culture where

swearing in public is considered wrong, and where political correctness

is the norm, does not make you right.  I for one consider swearing not

generally directed at anyone not particularly offensive.  Also, I do not

particularly buy the story the hearing swear words damages the minds of

young people.  Not that I am claiming that GC cannot handle his mud

anyway he wants.  On the contrary, he is free to have as ridiculous a set

of rules as wants to.  You will also notice that I don't swear on public

channels, and avoid swearing in general.  Thus I am not a proponent of

swearing on any other basis other than that swearing comes under the

freedom of speech, which I like to think of great importance in any

society.

As to policing ourselves, I agree with Kierthos.... ;-)

Now for my two cents, what you do with your tells is your business, but

if you are using a public channel whether it is offensive or not doesnt

matter to me, it is just plain impoliteness to use such words in mixed

company, the mixture including ladies, gentlemen, boys and girls.  So

bottom line is conduct yourself with a little dignity and respect those

that may not wish to hear what you have to say.  Freedom of speech does

not give you the right to be heard.

average hp is based on your class and a secret formula that includes your

is factored against your shoe size relative to the cardinal direction

most closely aligned to the facig of your computer (I hear it helps if

you mud suspended from the ceiling upside down).  11 suspended from the

ceiling upside down.  At the least, if it doesn't, by the time the blood

finishes rushing to your head and you pass out you will have had several

interesting visions and may come up with the real solution on your own

anyhow).


In all actuality I have no clue how it determined, so don't bother asking

Killing townfolk~
Atrax~
Well I'm saying my 2 cents on this matter, take it as you will, it is

merely MY opinion.


The fact that guards/shopkeepers/townfolk have become 'fair game' seems

quite a bit unfair to me.  First of all, darks have been given free

access into all of the light-race towns, with the only exception being

evils into chiiron.


Next, calling for help is busted.  Darks are being given free reign to

kill high-xp mobs who were never designed to be killed on a 1 by 1 basis,

but to group together.


Next, reputations are busted.  Darks can keep killing light-race guards

over and over and over with no penalty right now.  You'd think after

killing a SINGLE guard/shopkeeper that the rest of the town should attack

on sight?


GC also publicly advised that this was legal as long as the xp/coins

wasn't too high...  How can the darks say that a level 21 person

receiving 70k per 'freebie kill' isn't obscene xp?


And for all you people who are gonna whine 'why don't you do it too?'


First, darks have been given free reign into all 'light towns'.  The only

exception being evils in chiiron...  Voaleth, Darkhaven, and Brithbarad

guards attack goods on sight.  Which gives a HUGE advantage to darks,

since they can cast a spam of spells before being attacked.


Next, the towns that do attack on sight pair all their guards up at the

gate, making killing guards 99.9% impossible.


Next, evil towns' shopkeepers and guards/etc.  are a LOT beefier than the

light-race towns.  I'd rather fight Typhoeus again than take on a

darkhaven guard.



- Atrax, who thinks that people are being given a free ride to do stuff

people have been banned for in the past is a crock of ****.

Monks are followers of God?~
Fingolfin~
When I went to create a monk, it said there: Monk: Follower of god,

master of unarmed combat.  Or something very similar to that.  Ok, I know

that TFE monks aren't European medieval monks who go around and chant

Latin songs.  But they also aren't Jackie Chan street fighter types who

go around having gaining only fighting abilities.  So now someone is

gonna say: What about meditation?  Well does meditation ( in relation to

TFE monks) have anything to do with worshipping of deities and following

a certain TFE god?  No, not really, it's just a cool way of faster regen. 

And it wastes energy, and we all know many types of meditation IRL are

suppose to *gather* energy, but that's another story.  Anyway, my point

is: What do TFE monks have with religion?  Are they just senseless street

fighters or followers of God, masters of unarmed combat (as stated when

starting a character)?  If we are followers of God, then please implement

some abilities/skills which help us, and are granted by our deities.  For

instance, ability "purify body" should be able to cleanse the body of

poison much faster than normally, and it should come from our conenction

with our deity, if you see where I'm getting at.


Thanks for reading,

Atrax's point~
Geriden~
Well, all the important people *cough* didn't become dark raced post-wipe

because the dark races were easy.  The dark races suddenly got _alot_

easier since all the important people *cough* became dark characters. 

That ought to tell you a little bit about politics, priorities, and

balance (or the deliberate straying from it).

Give it a little time, when enough people are done reaping the benefits

of this overcompensation for a couple of the important dark-raced

dark-clanned people's whines, it'll get changed back, or hidden somehow.

Or maybe the imms wanted a world where the traditional base-level Tolkienesque

values on light and dark races are laughed at, where elves don't make

mithril and dwarves can't make as good of armor as orcs, who are supposed

to steal it, and where a band of ogres and trolls previously defined as

"unreliable at best" defends their remarkably affluent and peaceful

conglomerate city from attack better than the Humans.

Nah.. I think there's a better reason.

And if reputations gets fixed, people will whine because they can't get

into Pennan and Medienne anymore.  But what're the running odds this week

concerning the future return of reputations, ever?

My advice, light races, is to first realize you're playing on the wrong

side of the field, many an "important" person has proved you can't have

fun if you try to be good or lawful or any of the stupid things like that. 

Second, go to Pennan or Medienne and start killing town mobs.  And when

new players logging on start commenting on how sad it is, and what's the

point of putting races in the first place...  well now _that's_ a

reputation you don't want.

they would do the same for you or your kin.  Now elves raised a big deal

about their people being killed and I think rightfully so.  I would like

to ask that something be done with dwarves.  I've pumped several plat

coins in trying to be come a citizen of Kha-da.  I really think maybe

beard rings or an axe quest or something to unit the dwarves of the

realms like they should be needs to be done.  I realize you imms have

alota stuff to be done and I thank you for your time in reading this note

Balance Of Power~
Atrax~
Re: Geriden's post...


My post wasn't directed at dredging up the entire 'dark vs light'

contingent, just the imbalance on the availability of killing townfolk. 

And true, while in an RP sense lights 'shouldn't' be as forthright in

killing evil townfolk (technically evil innocents) it still seems 'wrong'

that darks should be given what seems to be a 'free opportunity' to kill

light townfolk and 'get away with it'.


Beyond that, I really don't see any huge 'advantage' darks have over

lights right now except for the reputations being busted so darks get

into light towns.  I also don't see how you figure that darks are 'oh so

much better than lights' this time around...


Just because Griffin, Irmo, Lani, Hyzenthlay, Hart, Kezef, and some other

'experienced' players went dark/evil, this does not mean that darks are

'better' than evils...  In fact, most of those people were already either

dark or evil to begin with, or just plain grouped together.


Don't confuse the fact that griffin and his regular groupies are online a

helluva lot more, work well together, and just plain kill a lot of stuff

so they're higher levels into the dark race being 'better'...  They'd be

just the same if they were light.


As much as I'd like to point out what I feel the dark race has in

advantages, I'm sure the darks could point out that with lights...  I

just like being an ent, and learned long ago to look past our race's

'disadvantages' and turned it into a fun char...


- Atrax da big (still trying to figure out a new catch-phrase)

(who I might add is doing just peachy as a light guy, like a lot of other

lights, even though I do miss a lot of my dark friends' company)

Another ranger's point of view...~
Aucassin~
How is a ranger's using his animal ally alongside him in a fight

cowardice?  Every class has some special abilities that other classes

don't have, and if I am in the arena or some pkill area I totally expect

them to use every means at their disposal to waste me.  Seems to me that

someone not using whatever they can to win better get used to losing a

lot.  Frankly, if I win a fight cuz I got a pet and you don't, then call

me a coward, cuz I'd rather be a live coward then a dead hero.

I have no idea where to put this note, so right here is as good a place

as any.  I'm currently writing a program for Zmud users designed for TFE. 

This program will interact with Zmud, making some of the more "painful"

commands easier.

As of right now, I plan on including options (chose the option to toggle

on and off), colors, prompt commands, a cut and paste for triggers and

quick keys, and a mail/note editor.

If you can think of something i'm missing, or something you would like to

see included in this program, please mudmail me letting me know.

(encouragement would be nice too :P) Hopefully the first version of this

program will be available (on seltha's web page?  *hint hint*) within the

"A note of thanks"~
Boku~
I have been playing TFE since before you could get out the west gate of

chiiron.  I have had some lapses in playing from time to time due to

school, work, life and what not.  In the end I always come back tho, am

drawn back by some unseeable force which pulls me.


Over the years I have seen many changes, some for the better, some for

the worse.


The world GC and Crew have created is wonderfully complete, well thought

out and interesting in all aspects.  I am sure that what changes they

make/made/will make are meant for the better and not done without a good

deal of thought.  To hear people complain or gripe or moan about any

aspect of this mud sickens me.


Having Imped and Coded two muds of my own I know of the amount of time

required to keep a mud running, make changes, deal with player relations,

etc.  Believe me, it is NOT by any means insignificant.  If you don't

believe me, try it.


I would like to take this opportunity to publicly thank Greyclaw, Merior,

Orb, Phule, Object and all the other individuals who have contributed

major parts of their lives to make a world which I can enjoy.  My hat is

off to you, what you want to do and what you have done.  As long as I

mud, I seriously doubt if I will find a mud quite like this one and for

that I thank you.

Lets not have the name police start sounding like the password police:

"It's no good unless it has random character strings, with lower and

upper case mixed, and at least one spcial character in it." It is

entirely likely that any name you choose (that sounds like a name) has

been used in some fictional work.  Im under the impression that the name

rules are to keep us all in theme and to prevent very childish names like

"Toothpick" or "Bubble Gum".


I think AVs should post their concerns over names that are questionable,

so that a higher level immortal can decide.  At least there will be some

consistency.

Arn....  your name is truly unique.  As for the rest of us, i recommend

One thing that really bugs me and I can imangine bugs everyone else too

are the people who just skin or steal from a corpse that you just killed

:( . I mean they just sit there while your fighting and the second you

make the kill they skin/loot the corpse.  When you do that all it does is

piss everyone off and put a few measly coins in your pocket!

Not only is the gain minimal, but if the people you do this to let us

HP not random~
Plagad~
This my my opinion on random HP, it's a little sided because I've been

getting the worst of it but here you go: 


One of the reasons I chose this mud is that you get to make your stats,

there is a system so people by luck get to have a better character. 

Unfortunately HP @eis@n random.  I was playing in a group a while back

and I noticed that someone with 1 less con then me had 5 more hps.  He

was of the same race and class as me and I took in account items.  So

basically I wasted 1 con, but he had 5 more hp simply by virtue of being

lucky.


I know luck is involved in this game, in things like combat and such. 

But @RHit points@n,@BEnergy@n and @EMovement@n should be definite, as

they are part of your statistics.  Fortunately I just got a good roll

@E20@n (yeah!) but these things are part of your stats and like hitroll

and damroll should be determined by a definite formula.  And maybe it

will even out but the fact is there will always be extremes and I feel

sorry for them.


The fact is battle is random but I believe stats should not.


@I @CP@Wl@Ca@Wg@Ca@Wd@n


@eOops, I meant damroll and hitroll bonuses on the score screen!@n 


--


After 20 levels I would be truly surprised if someone has less con but

more hp.  HP may be random but the probability of deviating far from the

mean is basically nothing once you start rolling 20 dice.

Yes but there is always the probability sombody will surprise you.

In my quest for higher levels, I have a lot of people throwing the word

little level 2 or 3 and takes him to bullies, only to hit four or five

levels.  I dont think big groups with big tanks in high xp areas is

powerleveling people.  I have spent a lot of time and work getting my

levels, as well as a lot of other people accused of pleveling.

About tank and heal~
Danguard~
First of all i want to say this note is not posted to whine about joining

a group.  I join a group when they need me, otherwise i solo, i dont mind. 

Second, sorry for language but I'm not very good in English.  Let's go

ahead...I just would like to let some big tanks know that sometimes they

would have to think before creating a group.  After pwipe we are runnig

big stuffs, but to do this the BIG tanks catch all the healers online

that time, and when some healer get online they quickly capture it. 

Then, if you ask them to join they answer you the group is full and they

are overkilling...but they dont say you that if you join you'll get some

good xp and fun, while they'll lose 50xp from their kills.  "Bah, ok" you

think "since they dont want me i'll create a group on my own", but when

you check for healers on chat...no answer, it seems everyone died.... 

I''m just waiting the day I'll run before frosties and I'll find a tank

with a only-healers group running them at lvl 35 :P 

If you've read it, thanks :)

kill stealing?~
Ickack~
What counts as kill-stealing?


I know it's kill-stealing if you attack something that someone else has

attacked, or if you skin a corpse that's laying at someone's feet

(presumably they killed the animal), but is it kill stealing to attack a

mob if someone or a group of people is standing/resting on the same

square?


More than casually interested,

Ickack the evil


***

Due to the wide variety of links, lag and other things associated with

mudding, we here at TFE say this:

Attacking a mob while another person or group is in the room IS

considered kill-stealing.  Role-play is not an excuse to be a jerk.

Please determine if the mob is a target for another player BEFORE you

attack it.

If you don't speak the language, point and grunt.


Breaking this rule of common courtesy is a quick way to become banned.

I don't mind dying, if I'm having fun and can retrieve my belongings or

replace them.  But I can't replace a quest item (well, not easily).  I've

heard that the speed of corpses rotting is not a bug and is intentional. 

I'd like to hear from the top whether or not this is true.  If it is,

this is a formal protest.  It discourages me from exploring, for fear

that I'll run into something I can't handle, die, and lose something

irreplacable.


P.S.  Zim, don't worry, my black silk bag was retrieved by the same

Next complaint. :P~
Kierthos~
Well, complaints, really...


First off, although I really like the idea of more role-playing here, it

should be up to the players who they associate with.  Saying light races

can't group with dark races makes sense on the big scale.  After all, I

really don't see a large faction of orcs bringing food to starving elves,

or vice versa...


However, on the small scale, there will always be misfits who don't

measure up to the society norms.  (I happen to be one, both as my

character and in RL.) There should be the opportunity to play a renegade

elf, who has turned his back on his people, or a human who can't stand

working with most light races...  and what about the little troll who

only wants to be loved?


Now, I know that if lights and darks are allowed to group without

restriction, then everyone will be that renegade, working with the other

side...  or at least that's the theory, right?  So why not make an

option, or a choice?  Personally, I'd like to be able to type 'opt

S.O.B.' and be able to hang out with most of the people I get along with,

instead of either soloing (which this mud really doesn't seem to be

geared for) or grouping with races that in terms of RP my character can't

stand.  (And out of RP, I'm getting really tired of all the 'nice' races

stealing my kills, but that's another story) 


So, in conclusion, and I know y'all coders are busier then a one-legged

man in a butt-kicking contest, but either get reputation working, or add

an option (at least for humans and lizardmen) that lets us work for the

dark side if we want to.  Heck, give it some kind of penalty, where we

only get like 2/3 normal exps or something, but at least do it.

A further bit on reality...

In the "real" world, if someone where to walk upon your corpse, and it had

items in it, they would be free to take every last single item in the

corpse.  In the end you would possibly be worse off than the current way

its done.

reality...~
Waylander~
Good thing we -stress- realism here, corpses rot in two minutes and the

items disintegrate with the corpses.  Now lets see in a sweltering jungle

(hot and wet) corpses decay in 2-3 months and that is an a rough 1440 to

2160 hours.  If a tick (5secs) is one hour, that would mean corpses in

the worst places for corpse deterioration are taking a whole 48 hours to

deteriorate, considering it takes 2 minutes time for a corpse to decay. 

Now considering minimum natural decay in the worst conditions is 1440

hours or thirty times larger than the current time alotted for corpse

decay (wow..this number will look familiar an hour real time) there seems

to be a point where machine resources took precedence over realism.  Then

you have the items contained within the corpses, depending on material

and workmanship the minimum something is going to last pretty much

regardless of environmental conditions is a year.  Now remember this is a

game, we all come here to have fun.  Losing an item (1%-5% pop) to a

death is more than a little irritating, and if you haven't noticed the

notes that have been posted so far don't say they think death sucks, its

the unrealism of corpse decay time.


Way the malcontent

One Player's perspective~
Malayne~
When I came to this wonderful little world, I fully expected to get bored

within a week as I normally do with computer games.  But I got started,

made a few friends, and discovered something really cool.  The areas here

are all well-written, and I enjoyed going to new places and imagining

what the writers here had given us.


A year or so later I had a character at level 59 with lots of friends and

some really neat stuff.  My mana regen rocked, I had great armor, and I

could change my stats and resistances with gear.  This was a world where

a person could have money, 'power' and stuff, and where I could explore

freely.  It was an escape from reality where I am a student.  It was my

main source of stress-relief and enjoyment.


I don't know about the rest of the players here, but I don't come here

for reality.  I come here to step outside of my often stressful life

where I work hard to earn a degree while not earning much money.  I want

things here to be realistic, but this is a game and realism should be

balanced with enjoyment.  It feels like realism has taken a precidence

over enjoyment in all the recent changes.  Sometimes it feels like things

were made harder out of spite, because we had gotten too big and powerful. 

I don't know if that's true, but it feels like the players' enjoyment has

been forgotten in the name of making things 'balanced'.  What about the

balance between realism and fun?


Call this whining if you will, I would just like to express the sentiment

I feel and have heard from a majority of the people I know here.  I still

enjoy playing, but I do have to say that there is a lot more stress (as

opposed to the more positive feeling of danger, anticipation, whatever). 

The reductions in what items do, to the point of making a majority of the

items that apply to me almost worthless, takes a LOT away from this game. 

The inability to explore on my own so that I can read the room

descriptions and see what's 'out there' has reduced me to running zones

with groups purely for experience.  (Until I find a new exploration

partner, anyway.) 


Someone needed to give our perspective, so here it is.  At least some of

us feel this way.

Socials~
Cylaria~
Having looked through a lot of the socials, and used them, and developed

some for myself, I encourage everyone to think about using them, and using

them well.

I treat most interactions seriously, and will not disregard use of an

inappropriate social. I personally think the person who is the object

of some socials should have given consent eg french, but I doubt this

is gonna happen for a while, if at all. So, I encourage everyone to think about

the socials they use. Don't manhandle a lady just because you can, kiss her

hand if you are unfamiliar with her, kiss her cheek perhaps if you are friends

(first person who uses this social on me, gets a BIG smile) and kiss her

on the lips only if you are good friends.

I personally am toying with the idea of gagging fwhap and pwhap and all other

socials that I term rediculous, but that's just me.

Re:Realism~
Laenier~
As Rue said, the corpses used to contain all your items.  I thought that

was a pretty enjoyable and realistic result of dying, and encouraged

making the effort to recover your corpse.  Then _someone_ lost a bunch of

important things, and lo and behond it got changed.

Noone likes a whiner.  But before the rest of you step forward and mumble

a flame (as people who talk with their mouths full are prone to mumble)

consider this: Alot of people, believe it not, DON'T get their equip

handed to them by their high-level pals.  Mmm-hmm, mm-hmm, it's wild and

wacky, but true.  Some people actually solo or travel in 2 or 3 person

groups and collect metal for custom armors, forgetting for a moment that

by the time they collect enough for iron plate a new builder will put

steel in a zone, and lug plates back and forth so they can create their

very own piece of equipment.

It means something.  That corpses lasted for a long time was realistic

and challenging, because you still had to GO GET the corpse.


My suggestion would be, if you want to make DEATH and the LOSS OF

EQUIPMENT a part of the game then make sure you don't bring back youth

potion.  That invention, created as a selling point I think so that

someone could reach level 90 and give others incentive, destroyed any and

all notion of the cycle of life an deterioration.

Destroy a player's chance of recapturing his corpse and you encourage

anyone who hasn't latched on to someone else's leg plates to quickly do

so, lest they bother to earn something and lose it because you can't

recover your equip unless you die to a rabbit 4 spaces outside of town.

Please update the areas list~
Kierthos~
Okies, I died a little while ago, and let me first state that this is not

a whine about dying.


Rather, it is a whine about the areas list. :P


Somewhat bored with the ant tunnels and the beach, I decided to check out

a few more of the local areas for fun stuff to kill, and lo and behold,

according to the areas list, the Chiiron Cemetery is only level 5.  Now,

being level 13, I figured I should be able to go through this area

without too many worries.  I recalled it from the pwipe as a cool area,

that has the added bonus of popping a cool item or three, so I wandered

on over to check it out.


Well, to make a long story short, I got hosed.  No sooner had I walked

into a room with one skeleton, when three of his buddies, a couple

zombies, and a ghost decided to join the party.  I was dead before I

could even spam a flee command.



Now, all I'm asking is that the areas list is gone over and the

approximate levels are checked.  I mean, considering that I am 8 levels

over the minimum, I should have lasted a touch more then the few rounds

that I did.


Kierthos

***

The 'level' you speak of is only a general idea of the strength needed

for a group of players to kill one mob.  Wandering into a room and

getting attacked by four mobs is not typical.

Once again, it is a GENERAL idea of the strength needed for a GROUP.

Rue

-----

My apologies.  My mind is almost always in the past when it comes to this

game (and I mean 4 years ago) and back then, the areas level

approximation was based on solo effort.  I have since learned that this

has changed.  :| 


Thanks for the quick response.  (Now all I need to do is find a bloody

group to hang out with...)

re:Chiiron Graveyard~
Erainn~
I have to disagree with the statement that being attacked by four mobs is

not typical.  In Chiiron Graveyard, since the new faster mob speed it is

the rule rather than the exception and no group of level 5 players could

solo a room full of 1.2k or higher mobs and survive..  unless of course

we're talking about one of the mega groups of 20.  IMHO, that area should

be rated at no less then level 7 and probably level 10 is more accurate

since you almost have ot have cure poison to run it.

corpse rotting~
Lyb~
I knw this is the 1000th message on this subject but anyway.  Is it

realistic that corpse rts in abut 1 hour of ingame time?  I met level 6

mage woh was klled by a bramble, asked me to assist him in getting his

corpse...  We did all very quicky but anyway corpse rotted.  It is really

often impssible to GET to an area before rotting occurs :( Ever noticed

that persons no longer carry around valuable items?  Like bags of holding. 

Instead they keep them in the bank.  I am sure that it was _not_ main

purpse for this bags.

Anyway, it seems cmpletely wrong and it stops peple frm explorng.  No

challenge, just frustratin (no one even bothers in recovering corpse

anymore).

Re: Reality~
Mojak~
It is my opinion that increased corpse decay was intended to make it more

difficult to keep your items.  It seems that this is the very fact you all

are upset about, not about the physical "realities" associated with the

decomposition process.


So why was it decided that you should lose items in a corpse more easily

now?  I would suspect its a few things..


One major reason would be as follows: Under the old system, once you

found an item, you kept it *forever*.  The only possible exceptions were

if you had very extended link trouble (many hours) that prevented you

from retreiving your stuff, or if you had no friends in group or on the

mud to hold the stuff for you.  The result: Inflation.  You have your

peaked wizard's hat, but they keep popping and popping and popping into

the mud.  With no way to remove peaked wizard's hats from the mud, the

hat becomes almost worthless.  If they are being lost in corpses or lost

to deterioration, they maintain their value.


Another reason is that death just didn't carry alot of penalties under

the old system.  The only thing you lost was a little time, and maybe a

couple notches on the high lists.  Death is *supposed* to be something

you try to avoid.  I don't agree at all with those who say that you deter

exploration by making deaths more painful.  You can explore all you want

if you just pay attention and think, which one important aspect of the

game (problem solving).


Trust me when I say that there are plenty of ways to make death more

painful.  For example, loss of *all* equipment *each* death, or the

permanent loss of a stat point, or the permanent loss of your character.

Than go an pop crystal ring after 5 hours in renegades than die in white

goblins and loose it.  Be my guest.  There is _no_ way you can even walk

to white goblins before rotting.  What do you say about warrior or

paladan which lost his, lets say, iron plate bp?  Very expensive pece of

eq, hard to custom, lots of effort and cp invested in it.  Or custm

necklace of mystic strenght, would you wear it anywhere all alone,

without a group?  I want even mentin stuf like ethereal bp or spiked

~
898716050
Re: Lyb~
Mojak~
Did you not comprehend a bit of what I was trying to convey in my note?


The very point was that things aren't always peachy when you *cant* lose

any equipment at all.  Not that I expect the eq-mongers to understand or

agree.


FYI, I *have* lost equipment that was very time-consuming to locate,

costly to create, etc.  and I still say that I'd rather prove that Im a

good player by keeping the item and not DYING than to see everyone on the

mud, good player or not, have the same item with no chances of losing it. 

Not to mention that all those expensive, time-crunching items eventually

lose their value as everyone accumulates them.

The auction channel used to increase this effect as well, because players

would get all this fabulous equipment, keep it forever, and not have the

slightest clue where it came from, or how to obtain it.


Ive played muds where there were DT's, where you lost all your eq every

time you died, and even where you lose a constitution point permanently

(hit 0 and your character is wiped).  I must say that dying on this mud

is relatively painless.  If you want to keep your stuff, think a little

bit..  plan your moves against new mobs or in new areas instead of just

barreling mindlessly through mob after mob after mob.  Think a little,

take a little care, and you will still have all that great eq, while the

lesser players will not.  I would think that all the competetive type

people would love to have another chance to show up their fellow mudders.

TFE and the "Challenge"~
Mojak~
Everyone plays here because it is fun, where "fun" is defined by the

individual.  Some people play solely for the roleplaying environment and

realism.  Some people play solely for the social aspects of mudding, and

some play solely for the competition.  The rest are likely to play for a

mixture of these reasons.


The people who complain about realism ruining their fun and their game

are the competetive people.  They want the best eq, to have the highest

level, to kill the biggest mobs, and to beat everyone else to the top of

the <title> High Score List.


Its fine to and good to play for the competition, don't get me wrong. 

However, I will pose this question to you.  Would you still play TFE if

everyone were invincible?  Would you still race everyone to the best eq? 

Would you still find fun in racing everyone to level 90?  I would suspect

not, because everyone being invincible, you could not prove you were

better than anyone else.


Without the risks associated with dying, there is no basis for measuring

your abilities against everyone else.  Without risks, you can blow

through areas without actually reading them or understanding them. 

Without risks, you cant get that rush of adrenaline when you step into an

unknown zone, or find a new creature, or narrowly escape peril.  The

competetive people should try keeping this in mind.  I hate to lose

equipment too, but I have been here a long long time...  and I know that

if these risks werent a part of the game, I would have grown bored and

left a long time ago.

Re: Lyb, Creslin, Mojak, et al...~
Kierthos~
Okay, I am one of the few players that I know of (Drog is another) who

can actually recall losing everything when we died.  Mind you, this was 4

years ago, and a lot of the really spiffy stuff everyone is scared pale

over losing didn't exist back then.


And then, the IMMs changed it so only a few things would get left on your

corpse when you died.  And although people initialled cheered that,

eventually, someone compared it to another mud, where you lost no eq when

you died, and a bit of grumbling started up again.


Now, due to some active little grues that haven't seen a decent meal

since the last time a Republican was President, PC corpses vape

incredibly fast.  And almost as fast as they vape, people gripe.


Well, you know what? Mr. Suck-it-up says "Suck it up!"

[brief pause]


Those who argue that it's not realistic: When was the last time you saw a

lizardman walking down the street, or cast a fireball?  When was the last

time that you died, told Death you felt like going to New York, and

checked out the Empire State Building?  When was the last time you

actually took a sword (or dagger, club, etc) to something?


Those that complain about losing stuff: Deal with it.  If it wasn't at

least slightly dangerous to adventure, if there wasn't a thrill, it

wasn't worth it.  I have played this MUD for 4 years because it

challenges me.  Not because I like the people.  :P I mean, I like some of

you, but most of you seem to be whiney little babies.  (no smiley here... 

I wonder why) And for those of you who complain about losing those really

tough items, like iron breastplates...  I lost three pre-pwipe, and I

never railed at the IMMs about it.  Suck it up.


And for those who take the risk of dying and losing cool stuff: Rock on! 

I'll see you on the other side!

RE: Calandra and Merior~
Quicksilver~
It isn't the loss of experience that bothers me so much about accelerated

corpse decay, it is, as Calandra was saying, equipment loss.  I accept

the xp loss as a reasonable penalty for dying.  However, the loss of a

custom item, or item that pops less than 5% of the time can be

devastating.  To have an item which you have spent several levels

patiently gathering the right items for, possibly enduring a death or two

in the process, simply disappear is, quite frankly, dispiriting.  This is

an unfortunate side effect of accelerated corpse decay which is, I think,

unfair.  One solution to this might be to tag such items as the ones

players are less likely to lose.

I have one question: Why do people even want to use names that are

obvious rip-offs of well-known names, manipulations of the same, or names

that were clearly not 'created' by the person using them?

When I see a name on who or ooc that fits one of these categories, I say

to myself : 'Hmm, is this person really that unoriginal that they need to

rip-off their name?'

All of you who sad "Yes, I've seen muds where you loose all of EQ when

pop rate of items?  And how many of them support custom and quest items?

I think I should be given all of the equipment I'm ever *going*

to gain right now.  That way, I'll never have to go through the bother

of finding it or replacing it.  Then I'll feel like a true

adventurer.


Also, I'd like to be taller, and lose a few pounds around the middle.

If that's not much more of a bother.

I just want to know, if so far has been a case where GC, or Imms, have

this I do not mean area change or something that trivial, I mean a policy

change, or a major code change.  Just curious, that is all.

Item loss and Corpse Retrieval~
Silas~
I think the item loss and faster grue-muchy rate encourages role playing,

as you want to travel in groups, or even pairs, more, and the "befriend"

command becomes important.  I am used to a MUD where you lost one item,

but lost it randomly and permamently every time.  So, this is wonderful,

for me..:)

It's sad that I have to explain this, but let's get it over with.  Come

Anyone who took my note seriously and either A) wholeheartedly agreed

What's probably saddest of all is that the anti-theme crusaders have come

No, no, sir, I believe the reason why banded mail is so expensive is

because the average man-of-the-streets in a light-raced town needs it

quite desperately.  With all the dark races wandering around, killing

them, you see.

*fans face* Inequity?  Surely not.  "Oversight" is the politically

correct term.  But don't worry, wait a bit, maybe they'll imm Snog and

respect me or else!~

Indeed even more so than ever before, a level should never earn respect,

rather a person should.  In the past I have seen many people demand

respect due to their level but if you truly think about it that doesn't

make much sense as most of the quality players take their time...  even

the quality non roleplayers have learned how enjoy the game and each

level rather than rush rush rush.  Sure you may be able to beat up that

low level vyan but that vyan may have role played so well that he has 30

friends to back him up.  I think one of the best examples of this was

Menolly...  anybody would stand up for her and we all respected her but

she never got past level *20.  In my mind she was a living spirit of TFE

and proabbly was the best representation of SKAP's old charter without

ever being a member.

Okay, for those who have expressed certain disappointments in Pulchit

Mr. Suck-it-up says "Suck it up!"


If you are in a PK zone, then you can be killed by any player that feels

like attacking you.  No one forces you to go to a PK zone, no one forces

you to stay, and you always have the option of NOT PLAYING THE MUD!


Pulchit is within whatever 'rights' he may have to PK as much as he feels

like while in the PK zones.  If you're that worried, get together a group

of 20 or so people, kill him, and dance around his corpse.  Or shut up. 

Your choice.

why is a pk zone an area that doesnt have to be RP'ed?  Wouldnt that

Why?~

Why do I do what I do?  Because I can.

The main reason why I played here was the fun conversations that I had

during groups.

I had a ton of fun with FIST.

I think PK is hilarious.

Unfortunately my main reason (friends and fun conversations) has

evaporated and taught me that most of the 'friendship' I experienced was

only there because of the powerlevelling cause, and now that I'm not a

part of that cause...well, you get the picture.

...

In any case, I'm just PK'ing because its my legacy.  I want people to get

smart, play rough and beat me at my own game.  Please buy about 10

scrolls, find me in gnomes, and whup my butt, I will love it.  It's about

all I have here now, and once I'm done with it that will be the end of me.

Re:Grimsza~
Laenier~
And third....  if you had ever been hit with any of the other weapons we

have featured here on TFE, you would put the quarterstaff on a slightly

lesser pedestal.  In personal combat, if the opponents are out to hurt each

other, they will do it, even if they're fighting with spoons.  *pauses

for the tick fans* 

I honestly don't know if what Malassin said about them equaling an elven

longsword is true, but if it is, they are doing too much damage.  When it

comes to blunt weapons it should be the character's ability and

statistics that determines the majority of the damage.  A monk wielding a

quarterstaff might do a good 3/4 the damage of an equally competent

swordsman with a sword, or warrior with an axe.  A mage should be

interested in getting a few decent hits when he/she isn't casting spells.

All IMHO, of course.

re: staves~
Gwynn~
A skilled staff wielder will defeat someone with a sword 9 out of 10

times.  The reason armies didn't use staves is because you can't use them

in formation or on horseback.  As far as Malissin's question about

knights using swords, they only used swords on unarmored or lightly

armored foes.  When they encountered another knight in chainmail or

heavier armor (although chainmail was the rule until about 1300 AD) they

would typically use a mace or a flail.  Besides, swords back then were

really just thin metal clubs.  Going back on topic - you are right in

that against an unarmored foe, the sword will do more damage on a blow by

blow basis, but the quarter staff will get 3x (or more) as many blows in,

and be able to parry and attack with the same maneuver.  If you really

want to add realism, then you'll need to carry about 4-5 different types

of weapons to cover all situations (much like knights did going into

battle), but it would be a pain to code all of that.

Anways, I'm just rambling, so I'll shut up now.

Re:Manook on ideas~
Aera~
Lets just say that your note totally disgusted me.  Are you out of your

mind?  5 avatars?  Do yo know how busy they would be?  Avatars are normal

people with social lives here who donate some of their time to help the

mud community.  They wouldnt get a chance to play their characters, theyd

have to become approving machines!  Everybody who is an avatar right now

applied to an immortal by sending them a mail with an example of a

well-written description/appearance.  The people who are avatars are

people who have written well, thereby displaying a good understanding of

the standards.  All avatars have means of contacing other avatars and

immortals when in doubt of the acceptability of somebodys

appearance/description.  Yes, there are some bad names out there and yes,

there are a couple bad descriptions out there, but rest assured, if they

are spotted, 9 out of 10 times they will be asked to change it.


And I agree with what Fleur suggested: I say we make you the lone avatar

for 24 of your online hours and make sure you make sure everybody who

ever has had, does have and will have a description gets it absolutely

@bperfect@n.  Then try to do with while grouping or dealing with a

delicate problem, add it to the fact some people dont speak great English

or just cant understand the helpfiles, and then we'll all see what you

have to say about avatars.

One more time:~
Murrough~
Since it disappears on the ideas board every time someone posts it,

amidst all the calls for new socials or 200 suggested uses for swamp

weed, let's try it here.

As a Unix software engineer I find that much of the work I and my group

do is not spit-polished products, like Microsoft apps... but rather

much more powerful software tools, for the use of the engineer, or the

average system's manager.

When you're geared towards the less-technical audience, like PC users,

then you prioritize the glossy ooh-ahh stuff...  in mud terms, shiny new

commands with marginal usage, fun little additions for out-of-character

entertainment...  a quick and way-to-easy auction block.  When you're

worried about the people who work with your product, the people who's

efforts and feedback and beta are vital to the success of your

programming, you prioritize supporting the tools they need.  The Avatars

are some of the system's managers, doing the field work.

There are alot of people who can't desc who want to be one.  There are

alot of people who desc like an angel and _don't_ want to be one.  Why? 

Because it's a big-time hassle and has been for a long time.  You have

to, at all times, deal with the OOC channel in all its juvenile glory. 

You get spammed by overanxious twinks who can't wait for your attention,

and you get argued with over the channel by people who refuse to accept

your decision.  On top of that there is a lack of consistency, and when

rejected by one AV some players, who I will not name, have on occasion

gone to another AV and gotten approved with the same desc.  Things like

these are the basis for legitimate complaints, and those issues mentioned

above are the basis for Avatar frustration (this having been told to me

by several over the years).  It is a thankless job.  So it should be a

priority to make it easier to do.  In the time it takes to code commands

that will be used for peripheral information by 1/3 the players, a simple

list could be coded for the Avatars and imms.

The command, 'apply', automatically enters one's name at the end of the

list, meaning they are requesting an approval.  NO OOC CHANNEL.  NO

SPAMMING.  NO "are there any dark imms out there?".  The list can be

applied to at any time, and even if you don't see the Av log on, they

will see the list and start at the top.

I was told once that you cannot be approved unless you're connected... 

and if that's necessary to the code, then logging off erases you from the

list, and logging on adds you once again.  When they get to your name,

they will look at your info and talk to you by tell.  If approved, they

'pop you from the stack', so to speak.  There is no "Can I be approved?"

or "I was before him".  It's all right there, and will stay there if the

Av has done 6 in a row and needs a break.  And NO OOC CHANNEL.

If someone is told to work on a certain aspect before being approved, the

'delay' command (I'm sure you can come up with a better one) will move

them one back on the list, thus bringing up one before them, giving them

a few minutes to work out the problems.  Each time they're reached, if

they're not ready, they get delayed.  If a player decides to be obnoxious

and abusive, or refuses to change a name, they get hit with the 'reject'

command, which either puts them at the very _end_ of the list, or removes

them from it, with no approval.


I don't see any reason why anyone would be opposed to this ordered system

of approvals, as it would reduce the stress of being an avatar, and also

probably thus improve approval efficiency and accuracy.  It may not get

the most oohs and ahhs from the unwashed masses (and I mean that

adjective) but it would be a beneficial coding project, as beneficial as

non-commercial coding can be.  Please give it some thought, while you

Re: Knightly combat~
Cylaria~
I agree with Lyb here, also, the staff was a peasant weapon, lacking the

esteeem of a sword. It required zero craftsmanship and little practice

thus not allowing the user to display any sign of wealth or proficiency.

Also, it may well have been considered Chivalrous to match an opponent's

weapon when fighting one on one, at least it is in the battles I fight irl.

To all those enjoying theses posts, they will continue, probably in

The Knight's of Misty Vale~
Cylaria~
All those who followed my brother as his Knight's know this: The Knight

Legion of Misty Vale shall soon return (assuming clan rules haven't changed

too much) and their presence felt once again. If you swore fealty to Utopia

know that I will honor his vow and continue in his stead if you

so choose to follow me.

To those with Goodness, Chivalry and Valor in your hearts, I invite you

to introduce yourselves to me, and enquire of the Legion, but remember,

a Knight's life is one of service, duty and honor. The road is hard and

full of challenge, but equally full of reward.

Re: All Complaints~
Lynitha~
To start off, I will admit, there are changes to TFE that could be made

to conceivably make it better.  I'm not trying to say that all complaints

are unfounded, stupid, unnecessary, and that the IMMs are 100% right 100%

of the time.


But that actually leads to my first point: An IMM's immortality only

lasts as far as the game.  In reality, they have the same limits that any

"mortal" has: Time, real life, and their own personal sanity.


Second point: Check out the number of players there are in the game: 1602. 

Now assuming that each actual person has an average of 3 "real"

characters that actually get beyond level 3 or 4, that's 524 accounts. 

Now figure that some people have more than one account, or that the

estimates are slightly off, we can assume there's about 400 or 500

different people playing this game.  Even with all those people, I

strongly doubt that any 2 people share the exact same ideas about how

this game ought to be run.  It's just as unlikely that there is ANY

compromise that can be reached to satisfy every player.


Therefore, it stands to reason that no one is going to be completely

satisfied with the way things are run.  Constant whining and complaining

about the same things over and over don't do anything but frustrate the

powers that decide how the game is run as well as annoy other players and

start fights.  As many people have said in the past, no one is forcing

you to play here.  If you can't stand the way things are run, don't play

anymore.


@yYou forget about the 50 people who I haven't caught multiplaying yet. 

But rest assured, you will be caught.  That will make 350 players.

Resigning..~
Fleur~
As of this moment, I will no longer be doing approvals.  I am tired of

all the know-it-alls smartass comments about us, all the snotty remarks

on ooc, all the impatient people that can't seem to wait 5 minuets even

though I'm alone here and already working on 2 or 3.  All of you that

don't do this don't realize just how hard it is to be polite to rude

people..  to listen to the constant whining and complaining from poeple

that can't get their way.  I have made it a point to always be nice to

everyone I'm working with..  but this week I've had a gutful of it and

so, find someone else to approve you, I'm all done.


Oh, don't bother commenting on ooc, I have it off and I'm not reading

flames.


Don't get me wrong, there are some very nice people out there that I

really enjoyed helping..  the ones with manners and were alittle

appreciative of the time I took to work with them.  They made it all

worthwhile for a time.  Unfortunately, after so long at this job, the bad

started outweighing the good..  So thanks to all you that were nice to me.


---


About how I often feel about the players.  They expect service and don't

expect to pay for it or even polite about it.  Amazing how many players

will get mad if I say I don't have time to reimb you.  Avatar's are in a

very similar situation.  Why should you be nice to people and approve

them when you don't want to.  The munchkins often feel it is their god

given right to have a mud to play for free.  Thanks for spending the time

on approving people - I appreciated it and have yet to find a solution to

this problem.

I just want to state that they do not get thanked much, I for one

appreciate the things that Greyclaw and the rest of the imms have done on

TFE.  I have been around on this mud for a long time, and i honestly

think that it is one of the best if not best mud out there, and this high

quality all comes from one source, the people working on it.  Things may

not be perfect, but hey, it is not a perfect world out there, and there

is no way for something perfect.  I think that TFE has achieved something

a little better then perfection, it imitates life in that it has its ups

and downs, just as in real life.

I for one would just like to say thank you.

The final farewell post...~
Atrax~
After playing about 20 characters over the last 18 months, I have finally

reached the point where playing here is no longer fun.


While I have enjoyed the company and friendship of many people in here,

there has been a huge jump in the amount of absolute idiots who have

joined this game over the last 6-12 months.  I came here because I don't

have a lot of money with raising my family, and it was a fun pastime to

eat up my free time.  Like many others, I became addicted to this

wonderful game that Greyclaw and the great team of coders has produced. 

While the pwipe has caused me a lot of grief with all the bugs, it has

shown me just how many people around here really care about who you are

and what you do.


Face it folks...  When it comes down to the nitty-gritties, this is just

a game.  Too many idiots have taken this game to a higher level, assuming

how you act IC is how you are OOC and IRL.  Until you've walked a mile in

a man's shoes, don't assume you know him.


Too many people casually throw insults around and innuendos...  I have

been one of these people, but I usually keep it to a minimum and have

experiences to back my opinions up.  Politics should stay out of a game,

and leave it to the slimy politicians.  Games are to have fun.


Over the time I've spent here, I have a lot of people to thank...


@gBalthasar@n - For introducing me to TFE, and showing me the ropes when

I started my first character on my first MUD.

@gZim@n - For following me as a cleric tank, and then as an ent tank. 

You've saved my butt on many occasions with your magic, and you

definitely know your stuff.

@gJemma@n - For lots of great conversation during long addiction logins,

and lots of help along the way in the early days.  Too bad we couldn't

have grouped more.

@gHomerus@n - Who taught me how to be a REAL cleric.  While you gave me

over 100 deaths, you also helped me be the 4th to heal even with some

strong competiton.  Hopefully you'll learn to ignore these idiots who

talk smack, and figure out that with some patience you can be a good tank

after all.

@gEveryone in the old clan Stor@n - I miss the days where a clan acted

like a clan, doing stuff as a clan, and just plain having fun together.

@gMorpheus@n - Had a lot of fun times over multiple characters since

Balthasar and I introduced you here.  Too bad I had the 4-month break

taking care of my family offline, I had a lot of fun with the time we had

though.

@gJago/Griffin@n - Had a lot of fun with miscellaneous chats about IC and

OOC stuff.  You both earned everything you have, don't let all the idiots

who spam all that BS at you get you down.  You guys deserve a lot more

respect than you've received.

@gMerior@n - For giving me a second chance after being such a complete

idiot in the early days while not knowing how important it is to act

somewhat properly in this game.

@gAll the Immortals here@n - You sure build some nice areas, and one

helluva place to play.  I'm sure you all don't agree with my views, and

got sick of all my bug/ideas bitchings long ago, but I still have

thoroughly enjoyed what you've done here.  You guys put up with a lot of

crap for no money and a lot of grief, but the results of your work have

enthralled us all.


To all you people who talk trash about me - Take a long walk off a short

plank.  The reason I've realized that this game is no longer fun is

because I'm sick of all the idiots who cannot separate one character from

another, one day from another, and IC from OOC from IRL.  People have

taken this game so seriously as to develop an OOC argument into threats

against me IRL.  While I spent 8 years in the Army's Special Forces and

can take care of myself, I see no reason why a game has to go this far. 

You need some serious mental help Dorian.

To the rest...  Get a life.  Too many people take things that happen IC

and turn it into something personal against someone, or totally bash them

on OOC because they feel they must act like idiots.  RP is not a free

license to be a moron or spam BS.


I really wish I could thank everyone who has helped me over the last 18

months, but I'd have to post about 5 200-line posts to say all the names. 

Through all the good times and bad times, and even though we've never

met, I consider you my friends.  Good luck to you all.

My opinion..~

Welp, bud..  I'm sad to see you go..  I tanked for you when you were a

low level cleric, and watched yo shoot past me, and you tanked for me as

a low level warrior (and again I watched you shoot past me) Since the

wipe we've been sharing tanking duties, and generally kicking a lotta

butt, but I still remember the old days, and regrets that we wont get the

chance to whomp vyans or many other zones again, and that I never got to

clan with ya.


Atrax, I know I'm just one of many who's going to miss you..  not only as

a good tank, but a good friend.  To the people who can't seperate OOC,

IC, and IRL, you probably shouldn't be here..  this is a game, treat it

as such.  I just gotta say, if the mud has just recently lost one of its

best Avatars, and now one of the best tanks, you gotta wonder which

direction things are going in.

Chivalry~
Cylaria~
For those paladins that care, here's my idea of Chivalry

Chivalry is unparalleled valor, honour above all else and passion for

goodness. One must be generous to a fault, honest, faithful, dutiful

and Courteous.

Some examples of Chivalric behaviour:

No flee, so the group may live

grouping with small people and giving them treasure before selecting from

the left overs.

Rescuing someone even though you're in the middle of a kicking group

Apologising when you were wrong

being Courteous to all in all IC dealings


More to come,

Cylaria

Chivalry II~
Cylaria~
Found this on a website, Really good explanation

Chivalry- An ethical code of Conduct


*** The Knightly virtues ***

Liberality Honor Good Faith

Glory Unselfishness Pride

Courtesy Bravery Loyalty


***  Code Of Chivalry ***

Noblity in Service

Death before Dishonor

Enterprise in obedience to rule

Respect for all worthy people

Honor all those above your station

Command Obedience through respect

Scorn those who are ignoble

Protect the innocent

punish the guilty

Courtesy to all ladies

Battle is the test of Manhood

Combat is Glory

Defend your charge unto death

War is the flowering of Chivalry

Death to all who oppose the cause

Arts are the food of the Chivalrous (especially music)

Anger blinds, a cool head will win the day


*** In Battle take on enemies in this order ***

Enemy leader

Opponents of great renown, enemy flags and standards

Opponent Cavalry of Noble or Elite status

Other opponent Cavalry

Opponent elite footmen

Opponent camp and headquarters

Opponent melee troops

Levies or peasants


*** Definition of the Knightly Virtues ***

Liberality- generosity

Glory- great honor, popular praise, renown

Courtesy- formal politeness, favor instead of right

Honor- Any token of recognition for distinguished services or high merit

fine sense of what is just and right with readiness to apply it to one's own

conduct in relation to others

Unselfishness- generous

Bravery- fearlessness in the presence of danger

Good faith- Trust upon word alone

Pride- A proper feeling of esteem for one's own qualities or achievements

Loyalty- Faithfulness to country, duty, or friend


*** The List Field (The showplace of Chivalric Conduct) ***

Courtesy to your opponent at all times

In combat if you are uncertain of a blow take it

Do not let anger control your actions

Do not let the lack of Chivalry in others cause you to be unchivalrous

If your opponent is your equal practice chivalric action

If your opponent is your better give no quarter

Remember your actions speak louder than words


Championship

One of the most important aspects of Chivalry is the Championship of a Lady.

When you find a person whom you feel is worthy to be championed by you this is

an example oath that you should use to bind your sword to her honor.


The Oath of the Champion

My dearest lady at this juncture I find myself bereft of a Lady to champion.

It would be a great honor for myself and my entire Household if I could fight

with your favor, and be your champion in this upcoming Affair of Arms. I will

do my best to prove the strength of my arms so that I may show to those nobles

assembled your great honor, beauty, and gentle grace.


If she accepts your offer of Championship she is then expected to bestow on

you a favor. A favor is a piece of cloth or jewelry which is personal to the

lady. You wear the favor in your belt as a sign that you are fighting for her

and that you will do your best to uphold her honor on the tourney field.

re:Atrax' Farewell.~
Fleur~
I remember back when I was a little cleric, many moons before Armageddon

there was a big cleric who was very kind to me, gave me some gear and

advice.  That cleric's name was Leviathan, who I knew much better than

'Da Big Tree'.  Like Atrax, this was my first mud..  but not my first

character and I've been here a long long time.  I can only agree that

within the last 6 to 12 months there has been an influx of immature,

childish people that can't separate real life from this game and who act

accordingly.  There comes a time though, when mature people with real

life responsibilities say, this is enough..


So, the point of this whole post is to wish Atrax a fond farewell and to

wish him the best in his life and to say, "Tree, I'mm gonna miss you."


Fleur/Melisandre/numerous and sundry other alts and their player.


@yArmageddon the movie or Armageddon the end of the world?  There's a

difference especially if the end of the world is being used in the past

tense.  So basically you would be saying that Atrax showed up after the

end of the world.  *I know this is way too far to go for a joke, but hey,

it's me!*

were thousands of pieces of codite looted, yet, when an imm CORRECTLY

removes all the codite from the game, as ALL of it was got through a bug,

you complain?  you should just shut up and be hapy in the fact your bank

account has not been wiped, because i expect that all the money in it

came from selling illegaly gotten codite.

IC and OOC~
Greyclaw~
I used to mud ages ago.  I stopped for the reason many of you complain

about.  People could not seperate the character from the person.  For

example I would happily attack random players for no particularly reason

and they would then send me a screen full of obsenities.  If someone

killed me I would laugh and say nice job.  Your character might dislike

elves but you should not dislike the person who plays an elf.  If you for

some reason you do then you should avoid them and this solves all

problems.  Being nasty in real is always unexcusable.  In non-pkill zones

you should not be a jerk and somehow think this is roleplaying.

opinion~
Aeneas~
Though I applaud many, if not most of the changes made by the Imms to

improve this mud, there is one that I can in no way approve.  In a way,

it makes sense that Light races would not associate with Dark.  But what

of humans?  The only truly neutral race, they can be both good and evil. 

But this raises the problem.  In a world where humans of any alignment

cannot associate with Darks, what place does the Evil human have in it? 

They can't function with LIghts, and now they can't group with Darks.  So

why have them?  Perhaps this was a subtle way of eliminating them...or a

mistake.  Either is a shame, though.

phulishness~
Phule~
Entering my fourth year of said phulishness I hope you've all had at

least a bit of fun with me, or, if that fails, at my expense.  A few

deletions, a few purges, a few pwipes, a few demotions.  What are these

few things in the life of a phule anyway.


But, as GC tells me, it's time to grow up and move on.


I can't speak enough of the respect in which i hold the bear, the boss,

and the countless others who've touched me and help me grow up over the

past 3 and some odd years.


I hope you've enjoyed the areas, and I have a couple more nearly done I'm

hoping to open before I gather my things and head on out to see what the

future holds for this old phule.  you can't teach me new tricks, you know.


I hope I've left my mark here, whether for good or bad it's not time

wasted if someone got a laugh somewhere along the line.


I leave you in the capable and loving hands of Rue, Merior, and Co., who

if you'll notice are probably ignoring you much less than I am.


Overall, my tfe experience has been one both instructional and fun.  i've

learned a few life lessons and take away more memories (transfer all, the

duck-dragon, the big red button) than i'm probably entitled to.

RIDDLES!!~
Cassis~
The King is about to die.  He sends messengers throughout the land

seeking for the 3 smartest people.  Finally 3 are found.  He gives them a

task to see which one is the wisest.  He tells them, "I will seat you in

a triangle so that each of you faces the other two.  After you are

blindfolded I will paint a dot on ea h of you faces the other two.  After

you are blindfolded I will paint a dot on each of your foreheads.  Each

dot will be red or green so that there can be any combination of red and

green dots, for example, 1 red and 2 greens, or all red, etc.  When I

remove the blindfolds each of you must raise your hand if you s ee _any_

green dots, i.e.  1 or 2 dots.  As soon as you have figured out what

color your own dot is, lower your hand and tell me." So he seats them,

blindfolds them, and then paints a green dot on all three foreheads. 

When the;blindfolds are removed, all three hands go up.  After a long

pause, one hand comes down , one hand comes down and the man says, "Your

highness, I have a green dot." HOW DID HE KNOW??????

~

riddle~
Mergan~
Label the people A, B, and C.  Say that A is you and your dot is red. 

You will see that B and C are green.  B will see that A is red and C is

green.  If C raises his hand, then B's dot has to be green.  If not B

would be red also.  Since B didn't figure his color out, A deduced that

all of the dots were green.

Actually its about pets not being able to swim.  If they get transferred

Separation of Dark and Light~
Kwee~
I wonder just how much roleplaying is possible in chance encounters or

even deliberate encounters with dark and light raced folks.  Think about

it.  You don't speak same language.  You don't speak the same gtell

(can't group).  If you're in a pkill zone, you're not there to talk or

make interesting gestures.  If you meet in public, dark raced folks tend

to spit on light raced folks.  And light raced folks...do whatever it is

they do.


I would suggest if you want to roleplay some, write aliases for

your own set of emotes that you can use in these chance encounters.

After all, it's quite difficult to do more than type 'spit' on the fly.


My other suggestion would be some bars, or inns, where free lancing folks

who don't care what scum...I mean what race they hang out with can get

together and have a beer.  Throw a few lazy punches at each other.  Have

drinking contests.  Medienne's got a few nice bars.  Denab-Knur has an

interesting bar with uh interesting games of chance.  (throw the axe at 

somebody strapped to the wall as I recall it.) 


Kwee


Oh and if you want some ideas on emotes, try some of these:


alias dark emote holds his nose trying not to smell your breath.

alias light emote snorts in disgust at your pitiful, pale face.

to hit with a 2x4 for making this game nice and enjoyable.  But now, i

need to go off to the real world and not be distracted by a game, maybe

get above a 3.0 gpa soon.

Special thanks to Gawain, Loriel, Staer, and Grae, for being excellent

Farewell TFE~
Sign~
This is not a note I have been looking forward to writing, however the

time has come.  I will be leaving as of the 29th of July to serve a

mission for my church in Brasil for 2 years.  I will not have access to

the internet, except possibley to check my email every so often.  I have

spent close to 4 years at TFE as a player, an avatar, and a builder.  I

have loved everything about this mud, I didn't always agree with

everything that was done but it was always well thought out.  I will miss

my friends from GEOF and from HEROS and from the short lived GODS.  You

were all always good to me as a player and Issib thanks you for it.  I

have made some amazing friends over this silly web of computers and

servers.  The stories that were told were more then just of the mud, but

of a personal touch that I loved to hear.  I hope that any work I have

done on the mud, however small it may have been is enjoyed.  Please

remember it is a game and to have fun with it.  The amount of time the

imms put in is amazing, and be patient with them.  Even if you think they

did something to aid a friend or themself think before you judge.  You

never know what happened or what the full circumstances are.  Merior has

done a great amount of good for this mud, GC is the man behind it all and

we all owe him our thanks.  I hope that maybe when I get back in 2 years

if the mud is still around I can perhaps return here to some old friends.


Thank you all,

Issib the pudge ball cleric/Sign the happy Imm


If anyone wants to get in touch they can mud mail Issib, I will check

that on occasion until I leave, or email me at billy@@wipd.com

Zombies~
Derjek~
I'd like a clearance on Zombies as pets.  I mean, rangers have to be Nice

to their pets, and not use em to tank all the time or whatever, and not

keep killing them off.  But, what about zombies?  We're not doing a nice

thing to them byt tamingthem, and their simply put, already dead and are

merely tools.  So, can we, for instance, use em to tank and when they get

low on hp, abandon them and kill them?  We only get negligible exp for

their deaths, and is not exactly a bad thing, since their aggressive if

we abandon them.

My word of thanks~
Kierthos~
While we're all taking the time to thank the current batch of IMMs on the

great job they're doing (and sucking up in the process), I'd like to

thank those that came before (or at least as many as I can remember).


To some of the original IMMs, without whom, many of the problems now

encountered would not be here...  :P 

(Seriously, back in "the old days", these IMMs really kicked butt.)


To Dragos: For giving us areas like Castle Lag, and for taking a certain

geek under his wing and being very, very patient with him.


To Amon: For being the original TFE "IMM we love to hate", and for

keeping many of the wierd ideas players and IMMs came up with in line. 

('twas Amon who shot down the idea of cream pies...  food AND missile

weapons!) 


To Sst'ra: For taking the lizardmen as his own, and making sure that they

had a home.  (If only someone would do that for the gnomes...  just

kidding!) 


And to some of the early players on TFE:


Let's here it for Silhouette, who with the conga line of undead grizzlies

and hill giants, proved that animate dead needed a little tweek.


To Merlin: The _only_ person I have ever known on TFE to take a name out

of history, and live up to it.


To Drog (the PkMkVII): Who introduced me to TFE (that's right, blame him). 

He was the Jago of his time, out-leveling everyone else on the mud (all

30 of us).


But most especially, I give thanks to Greyclaw..  without whom I wouldn't

have ever found this wonderful world that I call an addiction.


And, no, this does not mean I'm leaving!!!

zombies~

Zombies don't get tamed.  The remaining life force is channeled and bent

to fit the will of the caster.  Therefore, zombies don't fit into the

true pet rules.  Especially when you figure out that the zombies are

chaotic evil.

Honest Assessment of TFE~
Drog~
I have played on TFE for close to five years now.  Sometimes I played

alot, like back in '94 wheon the high list was first made aond I saw that I

was playing too much cause I had the #1 aond #2 chars.  Sometimes I didon't

play as much, like from '96 to about five months ago wheon I only levelled

maybe twice.  I was eveon aon imm on this mud for a while, so I think I

have seeon TFE from a variety of differeont perspectives aond here is my

honest assessmeont of this MUD.

First, I would like to say that the interface betweeon the MUD aond the

player is one of the best I have seeon on aony MUD aonywhere.  This is

because GC has put alot of time into rewriting the Diku code to fit his

desires aond players desires.  Second, I think that the fact that this MUD

is completely uonique in its spell lists aond areas is a great advaontage. 

Nobody caon say something like, "but bilbo always poped the one ring on

Mystic Adveontures." on this mud because there are ono common areas with

other muds.  Third I would like to say that the economy system. aond the

customing of items on this MUD makes this place extremely compelling to

play.  These are features you will see nowhere else aond if you do see it,

it will certainly be in aon inferior versin.

Now that I've writteon about the things I like about TFE, I will write

about some problems I see either existeont already or developing on TFE. 

The biggest problem I see facing TFE is aon ingrained aonimosity betweeon

players aond imms that I do onot recall from my days as aon imm.  It seems

as though many players percieve every chaonge in the MUD as a direct

attempt to either weakeon their race/class/aligonmeont or as aon assault on

them directly.

Conversely, it seems many imms take great pleasure in acting as though

chaonges ARE being made specifically to make things tougher on players. 

Neither of these attitudes are productive to developing a healthy

relationship between imms and players.  Without a healthy relationship

between players and imms, it makes the imms jobs here much more difficult. 

When an imm has to spend time looking at whether players are failing to

report, or even abusing bugs, it detracts from the time they have to

spend building areas and writing new quests/secrets.  I know as an imm I

much preferred writing mobs, items, and areas to tracking down cheating

players or pesky bugs.  And this perpetuates the cycle of imms seeing the

players as an annoyance.

Another problem I see developing on TFE is the increasing bi-polarization

of the MUD.  The split into two groups, one termed light and the other

dark in the name of role laying has caused a number of unforseen problems.

I have always viewed roleplaying as the creation of a persona and then

acting it out.  The current system. sets up a bianary opposition, where

light is defined as not-dark , and dark is defined as not-light.  The

raison d'etre for these two groups is work for the destruction of the

other as set up.  But, in doing so they are working for the desruction of

their own definition.  Additionally, since darks and lights can only have

very limited contact (except for in areas) there is very little room for

true dislike or hate rp.  Spitting on every vyan or elf you see is not

rp, it is simplistic.  True rp should be situational.  I agree with the

idea that most vyans should hate most rlves and vice-versa, but what

happens in the case of the elf who offers to be a traitor and let the

vyans march into vaasa?  Is he still a lighty?  I don't think there is

enough room to allow for situations like that under the current RP system.. 

I still wish(though I know the imms don't have enough time for it) for a

day when each race would have its own city and all newbies would start in

their racial city.  There are many more options open if there is not a

bi-polar situation.  Obviously the elves and vyans would always still be

opposed, but there is no reason ogres and lizardmen could not work

together if need be under such a system.  The bi-poloarization is what I

think has caused many of the polite players to leave TFE in the last few

months.  Well I have ranted long enough.  I do like the mud or I wouldn't

have gone to all this trouble.

Apology~

I apologize for what i did today in bullies, group was a little mad that

we came all this way for nothing, you were outside of the area and i

didn't know you had started on it yet or just arrived or what . 


Only reason i hung around as long as i did is because my cleric voided

and i had to wait for him to return, then i left.

Common courtesy~
Ganelon~
I'd have hoped that courtesy would be more ingrained by now, but I'm

probably too optimistic...


Characters are all in the lower levels right now.  Zones are crowded. 

Before walking all the way to a distant zone it is worth your while to

check (on gossip, _not_ chat) whether it is already occupied.  It is also

not good form to assume a 2nd group is too small or incompetent to kill

the mobs you were running there for, using it as a convenient excuse to

race in anyway.


It doesn't matter whether another group is light or dark, negotiate by

tells when you find a zone is occupied.  I'm sure the admins would much

rather not babysit players who can't be bothered to settle things nicely

without their intervention.

rudeness and claiming zones~
Talis~
I only wish the real world worked the way people seem to think is

mandatory here.  I couldn't manage to count the number of times I would

have received a job because I placed my application before the person

they hired.  (Hey, I was here to apply first and I'm going to stay here

until they hire me.  That means you have to come back next time they

advertise a position.) 


Don't misinterpret this now.  We do have a policy against stealing kills,

harassing people and being a general pain in the neck.  I also know there

are a lot of jerks out there being a nuisance, and we will enforce our

policies.  I just can't begin to fathom how people can claim an entire

area.


Granted, if you were there first you may get first dibs on what your

killing.  But that generally comes with the territory.  You got there and

attacked it first so its your.  If you kill every guard in a place and

someone comes along and just kill the chieftain, well maybe I can see a

complaint.  But sitting on an entire area and saying no one else can be

there?  Come on.


You people have to learn to share.  Even I've dealt with it.  I made

some low level test mortals and tried running small zones.  I kill maybe

1 deer, start on another, have to rest and when I wake up some level 10+

character has come through and killed every rabbit, goat and dear nearby

because they can and they need money or something.  While they could be a

little more courteous, the truth is they have as much right to be there

as I do.


I'd hate to think we need a policy stating that whatever group got there

first owns an area and we have to make others go away.  I sincerely doubt

that would ever happen, its ludicrous.  How bored would you be waiting on

a group of ten level 2 people slowly killing gremlins and resting 10

times for each gremlin and you're kicked out because they were there

first?  (ok, a bit drastic, but its the same thing!) 


I also know there are plenty of good people out there who do share. 

Kudos to you all.  As I also know there are people who abuse everything

they can find.  Almost invariably they get in trouble and then we can rip

out their hearts and feed them to our pet lag beast in a long, slow,

painful process.  Unfortunately too much of the whining seems to be

people who's only complaint is that "they were there first and they have

rights to the area".  (if you haven't coplained this before, then this

note doesn't mean you :) Just do one thing.  Share.  Its good for your

blood pressure and kinder on imms who do like to read over the noteboards

as well as keep gossip on so we can reply to real problems.

900026814
RE: Talis~
Griffin Tgar~
I agree with most of the post, however, there is one point I'd like to

make.  There are, in fact some zones that are too small to be run by 2

groups.  Bullywugs is one example of one of those zones.  When I bring a

group into an area, I intend to run the entire thing, Unless it's one of

Terek's 400000 room areas :P 


I see no problem with another group running the forgotten soldiers when

I'm in the waste's forests, or if someone is running the city inside

frost giants, usually they won't mind a group running the outside with

the big worm.


All it is is that the group who was there second can work out many

different solutions with the group that was there.  I normally do, unless

the other group is being complete pricks about it, in which case I either

go run another zone, or run the zone faster than they can 


Griff - who reminds you that where common courtesy doesn't work, a

tougher group does.

Re: Praise, Farewells~
Greyclaw~
See these subjects many times on the general board.  Farewells are mildly

funny as I've seen 5-6 farewells from a few people and more often then

not I see the person return in some other disguise.  If the person really

is sick of the mud they normally don't care enough to post a note.


In regards to general praise it serves no purpose.  If you like something

in particular then perhaps but that you play says you like the game.  Not

to be harsh but words mean very little.  Try to be constructive.  I'd

much rather see an unbiased review of the mud than see someone say the

mud is great.


Running a mud is a bit like teaching students.  They all are exceedingly

nice to your face as they want an A, but this tells you nothing about

what they think of you.  Would much prefer people who are honest.

concerns~
Umraniya~
For a low and up-and-coming character, there are a few concerns I have. 

Several basic skills and spells are still broken and, because of this,

the low level character is having to spend far more practice points than

he should These skills are: punch, kick, create light and shield.  The

first three are prereqs for other very important abilities acquired on or

before level 15 for most characters.  I have barely enough practice

points as it is, but the necessity to train punch and kick up to level 7

is putting undue strain on all but those who have a very high int and wis. 

I'm sure the coders are quite busy, but these should really be fixed soon

so that we can have the chance for improves.  Otherwise I don't see how I

can afford to acquire all my new skills at the proper level, even just to

train them to level 1, at my projected rate of practice point gain.  -

P.S.  I know that create light isn't specifically broken, but practicing

it is now unadvisable, unless you want to have 100 green balls following

you around.

900084263
Clans~
Laenier~
Just a friendly observation, but you really ought to come up with a

_purpose_ or a _premise_ before anything else.  "Light" clan or "dark

clan" or "neutral" clan tells us really nothing, and the players can't

decide whether they'll be clanning, on the whole, until they know what

they'll be committing to.  Part of the reason many people may be hesitant

is because last time around the clans were sometimes about as shallow as

your average networked Starcraft guild.  "Kill.  Group together.  Level. 

Share equip." What clan *doesn't* do that?

It got to a point where it was very sad.

Because if the pre-wipe ridicule of clan charters taught us anything,

it's this: If you don't stand for anything besides providing easier

methods of grouping, don't bother making a clan.  Save the money and just

power-rank normally.

Derjek's note is intriguing.  He/she isn't promising anything, except the

ability to play according to certain principles along with others who

plan on playing the same way, and possibly accomplishing something,

should the game ever take that step over to "dynamic".  Clans are

close-knit groups of people with strong loyalties and a driving purpose,

a constant goal.  Establish a respectable purpose, then ask who'll

consider joining.  :)

Clanning~
Jocelyn~
I realize that right now there will be alot of people trying to and

creating clans.  I am currently working on a charter for a clan myself. 

I am not sure how many people are interested in clanning at all right

now, but if you'd be interested in hearing the basis for the clan, and/or

you have any really good suggestions...  please mud mail me.  To clan you

have to be over level 10, but since it has not been created (and may not

be) if anyone is interested let me know, and we'll work on levels etc.


Jocelyn


PS.  I am working on a charter and purpose, but I know one thing for

certain at this point.  I do not plan to have a clan that is shallow and

based only on cash and levelling.  Yes I would help people wanting to

join to level.  But I believe in helping whoever I can whenever I can.  I

asked for those interested to mail me and we can discuss future clan

plans.  But I know that if I do indeed clan it will be nothing like the

clans of pre-wipe, and defiitely will have a good purpose.

More on clans~
Laenier~
Well now, this went around on the ooc channel so why not make it one of

those innocent topics of discussion.

I was reading the SKAP charter, which is pretty cool, much more direction

than before.  But I got a bit of a chuckle, as I'm sure some others did,

by the "We ruled the world and enslaved all our enemies until the gods

threw us down" aspect.  :) 

Now since this impacts the game not one bit there's *no* reason for this

to be labeled "bad" or anything silly, or for anyone to get their boxers

in a bind.  I just hope if "The Crusaders for Light-Raced Order" decide

to claim to have burnt Denab down and turned the Voaleth caverns into a

halfling stickball field hundreds of years ago, they get the same degree

of "latitude" when it comes time for approvals.  It's all in the name of

fun, after all.  :)

governments regarding an alliance, many people have agreed and work shall

begin shortly on the freeing of the highlands from the grips of evil

control.  In quiet, dwarves move against the goblins near the Dwarven

Capital Kha-da, repeatedly driving them back.  Near the Gnomish community

in the Black Hills Road area, expeditions enter to defend the helpless

youths.  And Halflings gather around talking and seeking information that

will aid in the task...


Soon, the individual leaders of their races, the Dwarven lords, Gnomish

leaders and the individual Halfling clan leaders shall form a small

league, designed to defend against the coming storm.

For we believe that evil is rising in the Plains and all aroun our

mountain home, and we must be prepared to drive it out.


Soon, soon we shall begin...the start of the future is nigh!


I.E Yes, a clan is being made, w have a full charter, membership, cash

and plans, only waiing for Orb to look at it.  :P

Dark Goddess~
Taeneth~
With religion becoming a more important factor of our lives here, I'm

saddened to see that the dark goddess remains unrecognized.  For now, I

am forced to follow a god, but I hope and implore that the Mother of the

vyan people will soon reveal herself to us again.


My great-grandmother, Evaine Khenistra, taught all of her grandchildren

about the goddess Mother and instilled a respect for her in us.  Her

knowledge was limited and based only on the teachings of her foremothers. 

I hope, soon, more information will be revealed.

Race relations (or something like that)~
Taeneth~
Slapping, spitting, spamming, waking, and other such activities are

completely uncalled-for unless you have a @breal@n reason to do such

things.  Someone posted a note saying something to the tune that all dark

race players spit on light race.  That's completely untrue.  I guess my

point is, I'm really sick of people who do these things without any kind

of provocation whatsoever.  It's unsportsmanlike, childish, stupid,

annoying, and downright rude.  And, despite some very general

steriotypes, it's not just darks who do it.


Oh, and don't give me some bs about role-playing, cause that's the only

thing most people around do that they call role-play.


Here's something to think about:

Oreade, I consider filtering the equivalent of sticking ones fingers

in thier ears and warbling whilst they try to talk to you. It is the utmost

thing we can do to show someone we have NO time for them. Currently I only

have Vorex filtered and that was cos he told me to do something quite

profane (I'll let you guess). So... if you  don't care, fine, I don't

really give a &*(), But if you have some respect for other people and

wish to get on in this mud, I'd learn to a) think a little before you

put your fingers to the keys, and b) take other people seriously.

To Ex-Rain clannies, and friends~
Xadzia~
I have almost finished my charter this time around, and I am looking for

charter members.  I am interested in any applications from new people,

but more importantly I am seeking some of my missing ex-clannies.  Even

if you don't wish to clan I would appreciate mail from any of the

following: Evergreen, Oberic, Nanette, Raistleorth.  In addition I would

be interested in talking with Vyper, Eltrex and Jyhad again, though I

think they all have darkies (along with Kanroc) I would love to actually

-talk-- to them again.  It would be very nice to get this new clan a few

old faces that I care for.  Currently I have almost every other ex-rain

member that I know of in the clan.  I already have enough charter

memembers to start the clan, but it would mean a lot to re-gain a lot of

my old friends and clannies sicne I still feel rather lost and aimless

from the purging.  I would also like to talk to people concerning the

charter, and its concepts as I have it, to make sure everyone like it. 

Once again, anyone in addition to these peopel wishing to apply please

send me an application.  Also note that this is -not- going to be the

same clan in any way, I feel that it would never be the same, I just

remember opening and promising to all of the clannies at the time that I

would let them return under me if they wish.


If anyone wishes to see one or all of the differant charters I have mail

me and ask.

I won't be back for at least two weeks, if at all.  Nice knowing you all,

bye.


Turns out I do have enough time to explain it a little.  My father and I

got into a fight and I'm moving out in a few hours.  I'll be staying with

a friend, but he doesn't have enough room for me to bring more than a

pack of clothes so that means no computer.  If Atrax logs in sometime and

I still haven't come back yet, someone give him the story in case this

note gets deleted.

re: Jocelyn and Laenier~

If I can recall correctly, not ALL of the pre-wipe clan charters were

without purpose and intent.  I know for a fact, having written several

and having been involved in a few more.  Before you go ridiculing ALL the

pre-wipe clan charters, note that most of the shallow ones were senseless

Light charters, and if you're going to go persecuting something, at least

study up on it.  Just reading those two notes made me sick to the stomach.

re:laenier~

If you read the Skap charter, the claims made within are of course from

their perspective and did not involve any history that can be proved or

disproved.  So long as light race charters stick to the same formulae

then there should be no problem gaining approval.

Re:Aeneas- I think that's where the word "sometimes" comes in.  It's just

a collection of letters until you actually define it, and then you come

to understand that the given description was not meant to be applied to

*all* the clans, nor was there any mention of dark being worse than light. 

You came up with that one yourself. :)

I was simply pointing out the fact that more light race characters

complain about things they aren't too informed upon, and, by golly *gasp*

you just happen to be a light race character!  Thats something to think

about....  I think my entire point is that the first two notes posted by

you and Jocelyn kinda wantonly attack pre-wipe clans, without making

exceptions.  That's my only point.  If you REALLY want to attack clans,

and can remember back that far, try the clans established before the

relatively recent clan changes had been made.

Top 100 reasons not to use triggers~
Sardon~
"Griffin rescues a dark orc mercenary!" "INFO || Griffin killed by a

Medienne guard."

"Sorry for not curing you, I didn't have my triggers set up."

"Vorex orders you to 'fren cow'"

"You skinned the chief with the mottled CAP!!!"

You sure are BLEEDING!!!

etc, etc.

Trigger Lesson...~
Seltha~
You get annoyed by people saying:

[OOC] Munchkin:

  "You are mildly hungry. Your throat feels dry. Bob leaps to attack YOU!!"


You get slapped by people whos kills you skin?

@I    A rabbit is DEAD!!


Well now it's time to put an end to those evils...


Firstly, you will need to put a %\ on the end of your prompt, if you

don't have one already...  So type 'prompt' then copy that text, and type

it back adding the %\ on the end.

For example:

@Iprompt ?p'-- MORE -- '<%f?f|%hhp %ee ?m'[%mmv]'!m'%vmv' ?b'%c'!b'%d'>%\


NOTE: Zmud users may have to click the 'computer' icon on the right hand

side of their typing bar for their prompt to come up properly.


Now, to fix the triggers.

Find out what the pinning character is (read your clients help files).

In Zmud the character is ^

Then get your 'You are mildly hungry.' triggers, and put a ^ (or whatever

your clients special character is) at the start.

So in Zmud we're talking:

^You are mildly hungry.

^Your throat feels dry.


As for your autoskin one, trigger it off "You recieve * experience

points." Or for a fancy autoskin trigger, visit my website at

Stat command~
Danguard~
I just wanted to expose my problem, to understand if it is really a

problem: I have a lvl 6 ent paladin with 16 in costitution.  Gaining my

levels, I got 12hp per level, and typing stat command it shows a 85hp

base --> 92 expected.  It means I'm loosing about a hp per level.  I just

wanted to know if, getting higher level, my base hp will get more and

more like the expected one, or if it is for sure I'll keep getting 12hp

per level.  I asked some imms, but they told me prolly the only one who

can answer me is GC.  I would like to have an answer just to decide if

keeping play my little paladin or not 

Thanks for your attention.

Stat command...~
Seltha~
Disable it...  sure it's interesting, but it's only giving people

information to whine about...  not to mention being highly out of

character.


In AD&D if you rolled the dice unlucky then you wouldn't have the

'expected' hitpoints, randomness is what makes all our characters

different, otherwise every character would have the same stats and none

of us would be unique.


And really, contemplating deletion just because your character doesn't

have as many hitpoints as an optimal character is dumb.  What's to say

your next character isn't gonna be just as unlucky with the dice?


Anyway, since we're supposed to be roleplaying, remove the stat command

and let us thank Caer, goddess of munchkins, for our strength gained

after many weeks of adventuring.  (not whine OOC about the stat command

telling us we didn't get as many hitpoints as Bob's character).

~
900734381
Stat Command... (again)~
Paii~
I disagree with Seltha.  Quite strongly in fact.  I do not believe he is

'whining' about his character.  I do believe that comment could have been

left out about him wanting to reroll.  I think the stat command is like

the identity command and provides necessary information.  I like to look

at my stats to see how my rolls affect my skills, so if I rolled low in

one area, what I might want to do in case I create another char with a

higher stat.  Many things are ooc, and are mostly dealt with as they

should be: ooc.  This is, after all, the general board.  I don't here

"Stat command this" or "Stat command that" anywhere other than on boards

and tells.  If you wanted to have a pure non-ooc MUD, than score would be

eliminated, identity would surely be gone, and many of the channels would

be gone.  And that would not be fun.  So, leave him alone, and leave the

stat command as it is.  Paii

Stat Command~
Greyclaw~
Command exists purely to reduce whining.  Was incredible the number of

complaints I would get saying "My hp are wrong".  The answer was always

you are confused.  The problem was that though I absolutely knew all the

complaints were based on confusion, people seem to rarely comprehend that

they are confused.  So I had the choice of telling them I absolutely know

you are befuddled but don't know exactly how which just annoyed them even

though perfectly true, ignore them, or spend 30 minutes proving that they

were bit silly after which they would just say "Oh sorry".  At least now

the people who don't know what the word expected means are too embarassed

to complain to me.  Also if I chose options 1 or 2 they would then resort

to complaining that I don't care about players which was just frustrating. 

I like the command and if you feel it ruins your roleplaying then don't

type it. :)


Now this isn't meant to be a whine about players but trying to give you

an impression why being an avatar or immortal isn't always amusing if you

try to do a good job.

jerks!~
Glambrax~
re: people complaining about the recent announcement and naughtyness

being banned I can see the point here.  Being restricted in how you can

roleplay is annoying.  but there are two very good reasons why there is

no room here for roleplaying a 'jerk' 

A: too many people simply cry roleplaying as an excuse to further

themselves at others expense.  in general they couldn't give a toss about

rolwplaying.  they are just bastards plain and simple 

B: there is no way to roleplay retaliation to such acts of jerkdom. 

Either formal or informal.  no pking , no justice system.  ranting and

public flaming ahieves nothing.

IMHO roleplaying a jerk is fine so long as the pure of heart are able to

roleplay wopping your sorry butt for your crimes
