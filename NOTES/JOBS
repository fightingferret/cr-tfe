@GCurrent@n


Working Rue on newbie-ish areas.

Revamping/Improving them prior to our grand reopening.

(no peeking now ;)



@GProgressing@n (these have been in the hopper for ages)

            (being finished as I can)


Vaasa spur - addition to the Vaasa, more like large woods

             adds space for a quest that's being added.

Deep Caverns - underground maze connecting Vaasa to Voaleth

               Under the Dragonspire.  Lotsa space for

               underground areas in there when I'm done.

Tomb of the Elven Lord - High level in Vaasa, needs Vaasa spur.



@GThings that will never be complete@n but I try anyhow.


More undead - to attach to existing mobs.

Clearing bugs board - sort of on the way side until reopening.


Shade and sweet water,

Mob changes~
Olah~
@CNote@n: Mobs done before adj_s/adj_p fields were added must be checked

for correctness.  What was formerly in the prefix_s/prefix_p fields

should now be in the adj_s/adj_p fields.

Mob appearance is: <prefix> <name> <a/an> <adj> <sing/plur> <long>


Mobs [1 - 99] @C*Merior@n (done, and has plenty else to do)

Mobs [100-199] @CTalis@n (done, looking for more to do)

Mobs [200 - 399] @C*Olah@n (done)

Mobs [400-999] Phule (done, won't do more as is being called a monkey)

Mobs [1000-1199] @C*Nereus@n (done)

Mobs [1200-1399] @GStarshine@n (done)

Mobs [1400-1599] @C*Nereus@n (done)

Mobs [1600-1699] @C*Florian@n

Mobs [1700-4000] @CCaer@n (@RDONE!@n)


Please post the ones you're doing.


@RAlso.  If you come to a mob that needs special attention, because it

uses 'the' in its description or you feel that it might be prudent for

someone else to look at it/for the creator themself to handle that one,

mflag the mob with 'rabies.' By doing this, a single mfind -a rabies will

show everyone which mobs need special care or attention.  Also, for mobs

that are not finished and not in the game yet, especially if by a past

creator, probably best to mflag poisoned them.


@GSummary - For sorting either questionable mobs or unfinished ones that

need recycled or looked at...


@Cmflag questionable mobs needing looked over with mflag rabies.

@Cmflag unfinished mobs with mflag poisoned...

(Necessary so we dont have to keep lists of what mob needs what etc.)

Hi, I'm bear.~
Fenlyn~
Here's what I'm up to...

> slowly dredging through object revisions.

> working with Florian to code trainer quests

> working with Rue to code as needed in Orlumber

> Working at snail's pace on a beaver dam and willing to give it to some

  other imm who actually has a brain.


That's all I'm up to.  Working full-time with Internet access, but not

always able to give my full attention to mud given the nature of my work.
