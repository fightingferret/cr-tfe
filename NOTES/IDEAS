Loop ideas~
Florian~
loop( all_in_group )-useful for area attack loops w/o having to use other

exclusionary functions.

loop( group_no_mob ) - useful for excluding pets in group without other

cumbersome exclusion functions

Before a Dark Cave~
Thentril~
From somewhere a voice intones: "The area below is dangerous.  Probably

too dangerous for you." This is a warning and should probably be in bold

to make it easier to see.

On reputation~
Kierthos~
Until reputation is working the way it is supposed to, could "Those that

sit on High" lift the little restriction on light races not being able to

group with dark races, and vice-versa?  Now, you may say that it won't

make much sense, RP-wise to have elves and vyans working together...  but

RP-wise it's just as much of a screw-job, to put it non-delicately, to

force someone who, In-character, hates most other light-races to work

with them if he wants to group.


Yeah, I'm talking about me.  And I'm sure I'm not the only human who

would rather that he could work with orcs, ogres, and trolls, rather then

endless hordes of elven mages that seem to have cropped up since the

world came back.


I mean, look at it...  a chaotic evil human is still classed as a light

race, yet will get killed if he enters most light-race towns.


Oh, and before someone says, "Well, if you want to group with dark-races,

play a dark-race.", I'll respond with this: 


I don't want to play a dark-race.  I want to play a human.  There are RP

reason why I want to play a human who dislikes working with most light

races.  However, until reputation is either fixed or turned off, I can't

RP the way I want to.


So, in conclusion, I would like to say that once reputation is installed,

it's going to make a lot of characters extremely cautious about what they

kill.  But until then, it's a nuisance.

Krynite~
Balthasar~
Seems shopkeepers don't sell it anymore for some reason.  Perhaps an

oversight?  (I hope.) 

--

No, no oversight.  Krynite is now a custom , for the same price at which

pinches of krynite was bought.  While minor enchantment is not suppose to

be nearly as rare as major enchantment, its not suppose to flow down the

streets either.  Krynite ore is rare.  The idea of shops always having

5-10 pinches of it was preposterous.  Now before people freak, and start

griping before they know all the facts, check out the custom.  It's

ingredients are much more common than say those for making krynite

weapons.  And can be found outside the normal sources, too.

Here's one~
Kierthos~
Similar to filter and ignore, how about an option to keep people from

introducing?


opt intro 0 - anyone can intro to you

opt intro 1 - similar alignment (goods, neutrals, evils) can intro to you

opt intro 2 - only those of same race can intro to you

opt intro 3 - no one can intro to you... you ignore them.

assisting npcs~
Derjek~
In towns, seeing my dwarf citizens in kha-da being walloped, I know its

not plausible to make towns a pk area but, why not enable a 'assist' mob

command, so assist the town citizens, or a tell to guard command that

calls guards into the room.

I just hate watching my brethren dying.

897968766
rescue~
Gock~
Make the random attack work again.  without having random attacks the

warrior skill rescue is pretty much useless.  also it's not always fair

to the people at the top of the list

Us warrior no like carrying wimpy thief around.  We want 'bash' doors

down!  UG!  Be good!  Doors be big but us be big enough to bash!  UG UG!

~

stagger~
Grimsza~
I think that taking more than a certain percentage of a mob or players hp

off in one hit should be good for a "stagger." I.e.  when I get a really

nice crit and take a mob or player from perfect to wounded in one strike,

stands to reason they fall back stunned for a sec no?

Same thing of course for a mage doing that with a fireball, etc...

Color level...~
Thrax~
For all those people complaining about colors.  Why dont you make color

an option level like ignore, etc?  That way, people who just want color

in their prompts and battle can have that, while others can see all the

colors in notes and mail.  This would work easily for when color in

emotes is coded in, too(*wink*).

Thieves~
Servius~
Just another note on the topic of thieves.  A lot of people considered

them a rather useless class before the pwipe.  I personally don't have

much of an opinion on that, but judging from the very few people who

played them compared to the other classes must mean that something was

wrong with them.  In any case, a lot of their skills have been raised in

levels.  A primary skill of any thief is backstab.  Why should this be

moved up to level 10?  If thieves are crummy before, why have so many of

their skills been raised?  It's not like they were ultra powerful.


@CServius, @Rthe inquisitor.

@n

@CP.S.@n Why does rescue cost thieves 20 pracs per level?  seems REALLY

high....

Ability to think for ourselves~
Illuminanti~
I'll limit my ranting to a few lines because it's fairly simple point.  I

think this dark_races/light_race seperation is pretty insulting.  I mean

we ARE roleplaying arent we?  Roleplayers can choose to associate with

whomever they choose.  Im very insulted that the imms decided to force

rp'ing down our throats and are FORCING us to not associate with opposite

races.  IMO some of the best interaction pre-pwipe was between dark and

light races, they joked and taunted opposites over gossip and in person. 

Where is the conflict between good and evil , it's gone!  You took it

away by forcing us to not associate with them.  *sigh* So many of the

things that made TFE great went with the pwipe, dont take away our right

to pick friends and enemies and to interact.  *grumble* ranting is over

now but agian this disgusts me and i wish i had never donated before the

wipe.

ignore~
Servius~
if you try to send a tell to a person when you have ignore set, either a)

ignore should automatically turn off or b) the person you sent a tell to

should be allowed to reply or c) you should get a message saying tell

could not be sent because you have ignore set.

consider~
D'Arvill~
Allow you to consider a corpse of something.  So that you don;t get 'You

can't consider the corpse of a bugbear guard' instead you might get 'You

look at a corpse of a bugbear guard and think it looks too big for you'

basing the consider on its appearance not actual ability.

And when you consider yourself, you should consider at 'Attacking and

suicide is equivalent' as it actually is...through simple logic.

Leather belt and pouch.~
Belgar~
I notice this was moved to being a main belt slot.  It always used to be

in the same slot as the belly pouch, which kinda made sense, allowing you

to wear a main belt and a pouch.  Now you can wear two pouches.

How about making it the same slot as the belly pouch?

Regarding Wanted board..~
B'yann~
Just an idea for the doofs who like posting and reposting their notes on

the wanted board every time someone raises a bid by 1cp or so, why not

wait and collect a few bids before spamming us every 5 seconds?  I like

to be able to keep up with the announcements and seemingly intelligent

debates on the general board, but seeing someone reposting a note all the

time just because someone upped the bid a few coppers gets on my nerves

:p

Oh, and PS: I hope the auction block never comes back..  all it does is

put equipment in the hands of clueless newbies, or people who couldn't be

bothered getting it themselves..  People who work for the equipment

should deserve to have it, those who cant be bothered going to a new zone

and exploring, or who dont even know where to get it shold rot :p

Voaleth is dark only.  The gate keepers don't allow light raced people

trying to get in.  I really like chiiron allowing dark raced people

inside too...

RP Between Dark/Lights~
Maxxim~
Players should be able to RP between other people as they choose.  I

think it is unfair to force us to feel poorly upon other races just

because they belong to the light.  This is not a whine, but honestly, if

an ogre or vyan wants to hang out with an elf or gnome it should be their

choice to make.  Not allowing the opposite sides to group up is pointless

and it defeats the point of being a 'neutral' character as well.  This is

just my opinion, which i share with many others.  Too many of my friends

are on the light side but i happen to like being ogre...


Thanks,

friend, group, introed, not~
Ickack~
A lot of people are getting back to that stage where they know half the

mud.  I'm sure we'd all appreciate an easy way to look for the people we

like to group with.  Right now we have 'befriended' 'introed' and

'unintroed'.  I think one more would be really useful, call it

'acquainted' maybe, which is between 'introed' and 'befriended' in the

who list and has it's own color on qwho.


This would work nicely with opt ignore, by the way: 3 ignore all, 2 allow

befriended, 1 allow acquainted, 0 allow all.


Thanks for listening.

ordering pets~
Freywin~
It's minor, but, sometimes I like to have my lynx lick Arlec's face. 

now, since i'm intro'd to him, I call him Arlec.  but when i tell my

kitty to lick arlec, he don't do nothing.  BUT, when I order him to lick

llewyrr (one of arlec's keywords), he can lick him.  I think it would be

nice if pets saw the names of people their masters are intro'd to,

instead of their appearance.

Opt Incog ...~

I think you were holding back on the incognito except for befriended

Would be really great if you could.

Borodin~
I think it would be a little more realistic if these guys repaired the

enchanted items they buy off players so that they can resell them for the

best price.  The way it is now, people have no real need for identify

scrolls.  All the have to do is wear the item until in bad condition sell

it then buy it back and maybe spend a few hundred on an id instead of

scroll price.

Re: Trophies~
Servius~
This could be done in a similar fashion to Diablo.  When you pkill

someone in Diablo, you get their ear.  These were symbols of one's power

if you were the one who defeated them....

changeing that and if not you might want to change the help file

Since speed change of casting time seems negligable, give spell a

Character birthdays.~
Alana~
Since we are a certain age, and we do age, and there is a calendar going... 

how about each character having a random birthdate when created.  Put it

in identity.  Then, if we want to, we can celebrate our coming of age, or

hitting certain milestones....  I would certain like to throw a party for

my friends at, say, 55...being an elf, probably means I've hit puberty or

adulthood or something...  Hmm....  a timeline for races..  hmm.......

Web~
Demok~
Considering this reagent costs about as much as flint, if not more, and

is used by some casters just as much, if not more, why do we only get one

cast per web?  It'd be really nice if webs could hold three to five casts

of the spell, cause they run out -very- quickly.

Mainly because it resets on the ground or can be gotten 'free' in 2-3X

the places as flint.

899079333
Re:Scabbard~
Laenier~
This would require some coding, but I think it might be worth it.


Premise: Differentiate between carrying a weapon and wielding one.

--'Wield' and 'draw' are the same effect, that of bringing your worn

weapon to bear.  'Unwield' or 'sheath' lowers and sheathes/restraps it. 

'Wear' wears the weapon into a wielded position, from which it can be

sheathed.  'Remove' puts the item into your inventory, i.e.  assumed to

be toted around in wrappings or in a bag (we carry far more than realism

dictates, but there's no reason to change that).  'Get' and 'drop' same

as before.

--Change town guard mob code to check for wielded weapons.  Warnings can

be given, and the character can even be blocked from entering town with a

wielded weapon, ordering him/her to sheath it.  Make banks, trainers, and

weaponscrafters' shops the only rooms in town where one can freely wield

weapons, and code shop-owners and quest-givers to refuse to deal with

them just as they do hidden players.  Once inside, if the weapon is

rewielded, town mobs may on percentage chance respond with a pose,

staring and moving away.  Guards may issue challenges, perhaps wait 10

seconds..  and depending on the character's local reputation, may even

attack for law-breaking.

--Increase movement cost for walking/floating with a weapon wielded. 

Make it impossible to climb with a weapon wielded unless you have climb

skill at 9-10 and that weapon skill at 8-10.

--Possibly change desc equip report to reflect the weapon in a state of

being drawn or sheathed.

--Encourage players to write an alias for *draw and *sheath, or *wield

and *unwield, whichever they decide to use, which emotes the action and

then executes it, with the coded command having a very simple "wield"

message.  This leaves room for creativity.

NOTE: Some swords, daggers, hand axes...  these sorts of things would be

worn at the waist.  Battle axes, two-handed swords, etc.  worn on the

back.  Some smaller weapons can even be removed from the vest.  Polearms

and spears are always carried, but would be at rest, on the shoulder,

when technically sheathed.  So the unwield message default would be

"stops wielding" as I think it is now, and the report in the desc would

list the item as 'unwielded' or some other non-sheath term.


Yeah, it isn't imperative to the game, but it would add alot to the RP

atmosphere.  Having to keep track of the status of one's weapons when

going into town, the ethos of one's pets when encountering a mage

guardian: these are at first glance a hinderance, but what they really

accomplish is to remind people to take stock of where they are and what

they're doing.  In other words, thinking like their character.

899085118
Leaders Condition~
Grimsza~
Currently when my leader is dead leaders condition shows as ??  in my

prompt.  This looks the same as if he had fled, or for any other reason

is not in the same room with me.

Of course, most of the time I know which it is anyway, but this can be

very confusing when you lose link in a big battle and reconnect.  Also it

doesn't make sense really, I mean, the leaders corpse is there in the

room with you, so his condition should obviously be DEAD, not unknown.

So the idea is that if the leaders corpse is in the room and not his

living being, leaders condition in prompt should show as DEAD.  This is

probably too hard to code, but I can't say that for sure, so I thought I

would offer it up.

On Av's~
Manook~
I think there is some shoddy Approving going on.  Appearances are smiling

or the color of thier eyes are shown.  Names that are common are getting

by.  Names that are famous are getting by.  I think that the Avs need to

be reviewed.  I think a way to solve this would be to have only a small

amount of AVs.  Maybe like 5 AVs would be good.  These AVs will then be

reviewed every so often by the imms or the players of the mud.  I think

that Names, Description, and Appearances that do not comply with the

rules should be reported and changed.  I think this will greatly increase

the enjoyment of this Mud.  Thank you very much.

Manook that notices the poor jobs of other mortals.


@yI think you are misguided.  I won't say anything that Fleur and Aera

have already touched on, but I really think that you are grossly

underestimating the job that avatars have.  It isn't just slapping a flag

on a character who begs for it.  It involves somewhere between 5 and 30

minutes of hard work dependent on a number of factors...  how busy the AV

is, how busy the player is, how stupid the player is (this does happen

sometimes), and the list goes on and on.  Things would be much easier if

players weren't as argumentative when an AV or imm tries to help you. 

But as for you, my misguided friend...  put yourself in their shoes

before telling them how much they suck.  Your argument is unfounded.

threaded noteboard system~
Phule~
So that there are not reams and reams of notes generally useless to most

people (see quarterstaff bickering on general board), a threaded

noteboard system would allow people to reply to notes, like 'note reply

12', etc, and start a thread of notes which others can read and reply to,

blah blah, and argue about quarterstaves to their heart's content (also

if notes look like they should be bunched, imms could move notes to

proper threads).

This way I don't have to read 8 notes about quarterstaves to get to more

important notes, like reimb requests to delete.

wear~

It would be nice to have a helpfile explaining the 'can't cope' and

'aversion' messages.  Also, when it says you need to remove something to

wear an item, it would be real nice to know _what_ to remove, or at least

which location you're trying to wear it in.

We could have phials of poison found in exquisite places, and when you

goat hide boots~
Xemas~
hmmm, they are worse armour, for a level 10 item, than high hard boots,

the easy to get level 1 boots.  they are a pain to get customed, and

their only good point is the rather low cold resist bonus...  what is the

point?  i'd rather have ac that cold resist...  mabbe they should be

raised to high hard ac to make them not pointless...

custom items~
Darion~
Why not make custom items worthwhile?

I went through all the trauma of killing mountain rams to custom some

nice goat-hide booties only to find that allthough being marginally 

better at keeping out the cold they didn't compare to my 'newbie' boots.

Again I went through the trouble to construct some baggy patchwork pants,

yet it doesn't compare to my skirt!!

also how about making the guy that customs the goat-hide stuff a trainer? 

he would be certain to have something worthwile to teach, perhaps

somethign rangers could benefit from?

*plead*~
Belgar~
Some way of filtering out the wanted board, without having to turn off

display of posting on announcements and gen and stuff.  I've been sitting

here for five minutes, and I've got about 20 pieces of info from the

noteboard.  18 have been modications of people's dumb 'I want a staff of

valor!  I have for sale a very tarnished bronze dagger' Two have been

worth reading.

~
899343729
Customs~
Murrough~
I agree with Darion, customs should always be much more worthwhile, even

than the majority of things you find while adventuring.  To accomplish

this you'd make a clear distinction between the two, even if the items

seemed exactly alike.

For an easy and previously noted example, take the white steel

breastplate.  Assuming you weren't being spoon-fed by a big clan or

buying shields off the auction channel for 50cp every few minutes,

customing steel armor took months.  In some cases, many months.

I remember there was an initial degree of respect held for the custom

plate armors (I certainly respected it and was one of the first to obtain

bronze), and unintentionally, with the advent of knight plate in Med

Cemetary and White steel in White Gobs, almost all respect was lost. 

Most people considered it inane to bother customing these types of items,

and would go directly from an enchanted scale to knight to a hand-me-down

steel.

At some point custom plate became a fair bit better than their popped

counterparts, which is nothing if not beneficial to the game.  I would

suggest making town-customed items _significantly_ better...  because

when you force people to shop in towns, the staples of society and

knowledge, for the best of what's around...  then you set the stage for

reputations and accountability: It can be very enjoyable and beneficial

to be a criminal or a branded enemy, but it *means* something when you

*can't* simply run an area and get the same stuff you can no longer get

in town.  Looked at in that perspective, that is the reward for the

lawful.  Customing is also quite a job, but it's not a chore...  it only

makes the product all the more valued.  And respected.  You don't hand a

mage 10 of them knowing one will reach +3 without blowing up, because you

don't have 10 to offer.  It's an economic motivation, and anything is

beneficial if it gets people to pause and drift away from the usual

pointsfest.

Please consider making all custom items undeniably better than their

area-popped counterparts, even if it means insuring that no valuable

armor popped in a zone is in greater than slightly rusted/tarnished

condition.

When you think of fantasy theme, the people who walk around and wear the

equip off the monster they just killed...  these are *new* people.  On

TFE, you're a regular soldier at level 10, an elite fighter at 25..  and

it goes on from there.  How often do you stumble upon that glowing,

demigod armor?  Shouldn't you expect the fruits of your labor, of lugging

components back and forth, building up the cash and finding the place to

custom it,...  wouldn't you expect it to be better than the item that's

been sitting on the 20-year-old skeleton?


Mm...  one last thought..  when was the last time anyone customed

anything below plate armor?  :P 2 years?  3?  That tells you that there

was probably a plan to begin with for economic and value tiers...  but

rapid area and equip expansion didn't follow those lines.  It's never too

late to go back and rethink them.

899345546
Dwarven mines~
Squigead~
How about some good races to kill other than elves...we got dwarf

specters, but they aren't living dwarves.  Be nice to have a village of

each race that could be raided by lights and darks alike.  Just as a

thought, a dwarven outpost, or perhaps where some miners are digging for

mithril.  It could have some normal 'Dwarven miners' and perhaps some

elite tunnel guards, like thunderers, or hammerers.

Plenty of cool stuff that can pop on dwarvies too...the ideas are limitless :)

~
899363335
Custom Armour~
Grimsza~
A couple further ideas on this general subject, perhaps the custom armor

could be made with a little less metal (350 pounds of metal to make a

breastplate that weighs around 15-20 pounds does seem excessive.)

Especially considering the limit on bank accounts.

I imagine this was done because in the old days with auction up it was

way too easy to have the auction daemons working overtime to haul tons of

bronze out of durfs to be melted.  This is no longer the case.

Additionally, lest this should be unbalancing (which I doubt considering

the poppable stuff that is so much easier to get anyway) customed armour

should be made custom-fit.

Making it custom fit would not only balance making it a little easier to

get, it is also far more realistic.

~
899363950
Armour~
Grimsza~
Actually, if we want to be realistic everything from hard leather up

should probably be custom tailor.  But armourers should be able to tailor

old armour to new wearers.  For a fee of course, a very substantial one

in the case of the heavier armours.

This wouldn't *just* add realism of course, imop it would help the

economy here too.

~
899364489
customing armor~
Servius~
Customable armor (plate armor etc) should take less crude plates based on

your race and less cost to custom.  A halfling's suit of plate armor will

not be nearly as large as that of a 500 lb ogre.

mage spells~
Servius~
This is just looking at the balance between spells.  You take a look at

mage spells between levels 15 and 20 and you'll notice there i only one

spell to be learned-freeze.  Perhaps there should be one more spell moved

to level 17 just for a balance instead of having 3 spells at level 20

which require a lot of practices.

@MServius Tullius, @CFirst of Seven.

is an imbalance there...

Goblins~
Snog~
I was wondering if the goblin race should have some type of increased

resistance to poison as the help goblin file would seem to suggest.  It

states: Their resistance to disease and infection as well ...  Not sure

if that would constitute an increase or not but it would seem that some

sort of bonus would be applicable either to poison resistance or disease

(plague).

Scabbards.~

For those of us who use swords, i think it would be a grand idea to have

scabbards.  Im not talking about any kind of magical qualities or

whatever, just something that we could put our swords into when not

attacking various creatures.

Scabbards could also serve as signification of certain events.  In some

periods of history, one gave a scabbard as an oath of his life.  This

exchange usually took place between close friends or lovers.

acid spray~
Servius~
Ok, there are lesser forms of all elemental attacks save for an acidic

one.  Burning hands and chilling touch are both great low level spells,

and if you look at their superiors they are a little spaced apart, with

an acid spell even further up.  Shock also has it's upgraded version

lightning bolt.  Perhaps 'acid spray' could be added as a weak level 6-8

mage offensive spell.  This would provide mages with another decent

attack spell which would be used even up at higher levels just like chill

and burn...

"Wanted notes"~
Snog~
us as players progress, gain things from others easier etc.  My

suggestions here is set it up somewhat like mails are and also what the

auction board use to be.  After all, who is paying for this note board? 

Where people repost notes over and over, playing with colors, getting

their note at the top of the list so people see it etc.  Perhaps a small

fee should go into each post or repost of a note that is made for this

board, after all it is in character and someone needs funds to maintain

the note board, correct?  This might also help to reduce some of the

idiotic notes which myself and I'm sure others have seen on the board. 

To conclude, would paying 1sp or 1gp be that expensive if it helps you

make 10pp?

my neckpurse on my corpse.  My befriended person managed to retrieve it

for me, but now I can't wear it because I would have to remove the cameo

first.

Re: Demok~
Fingolfin~
This is the last note I'm gonna post on the subject.  Not that Imms are

gonna accept your idea anyway, but here goes.  Haste would make one

class, monks in particular, far too powerful when compared to other

classes.  My ex-clan leader, Mophus (lev 65 monk then), killed a dark

pikeman in half a round while hasted.  What other class could possibly do

that?  Level 89 warrior couldn't probably do that.  If you don't know

what a dark pikeman is, go see dark citadel.  It's a 200k mob which

average attack is MUTILATE, and has a specials which does *PULVERIZE*. 

My point is, monks with haste would be far too powerful, compared to any

other class.

And that's not the balance the Imms are after.

Make it easier.~
Razu~
This mud makes it too hard on the players.  All the changes

(improvements) make it even harder.  This is just a game - games are

supposed to be fun.  Why should a poor newbie have to kill 30 rabbits to

buy some armor, and kill 30 more to repair it.  Then spend a week saving

up for a decent weapon?  The rewards/cool things are too few and too far

between to make this mud very enjoyable.  Ease up on the players a bit. 

After all you have no mud without them.

--

So killing a rabbit should net you more exp?  Like poor mr.  wabbit is

that hard.  Starting out isn't a cake walk, I'll grant you that.  But if

it were, there would be no point to it.  As far as 'rewards' and 'cool

stuff' being too few and far between, then perhaps you are not looking in

the right places.  One of this mud's features is builder programable

codes, which allows for each area to have as many 'search for secret

stuff', 'move rock for golden treasures', 'push buttons for mystic

clans and armor~
Julien~
Was just thinking that it would be a cool addition for clans if you could

have the clan emblem etched into customable armor (at the time of

customing, of course).  It would be a simple matter of using existing

customs, only adding a material to the list, that being 'emblem of

<blah>'..  and the appearance of the said armor would be changed to

something like 'steal breastplate with an emblem of <blah> etched on it'

But the exact wording doesn't really matter..  It would just add a bit of

style to the wardrobe..  sorta like a coat of arms.  Could have armor,

shields, helmets, etc all with the clan emblem.  The only possible snag

in this idea would be the description of the armor.  But I'm sure that a

system could be worked out.  And even if it couldn't, I'm sure that

people would still love to have it at least change the appearance. 

Whelp, that's pretty much all I have for now.

Depending on the profecientcy you have in the language that the parchment

Damage tables~
Snog~
I've been looking at the damage tables and I was wondering if it'd be

possible to put a little consistency into it.

For example:

* VAPORIZES * has only one star and does up to 200 hp of damage.

For physical damage up to 200, you have: ** DEMOLISHES ** 


I guess my point is that the caps and stars added to the damage words

aren't consistant.  Suggestion being, have damage 1-50 for any type of

damage be regular letters, no caps.  For damages ranging from 51-100hp,

caps would be added.  Damages of 101-200hp would have a single "*"

(giving a basic damage of 100+hp Like-wise, for 201-300hp of damage, two

stars ( ** ) would be added and for 301+ damage, there would be 3 stars -

"***"

I hope this makes some sense and that it is considered as it would make

the magic casters look better compared to the monks with the damage being

done.

- Snog -

Talked with a few people, 10 or so, they all agreed it made sense except

Griffin who didn't come up with the idea so didn't like it.

~
899875997
Damage tables cont.~
Snog~
Change the current physical damage table to the following.  Here 1-50 is

not in caps, 50-100 is in caps, 100-200 has one "*", 200-300 has "**" and

300+ has "***".


scratches...................0-1hp

grazes......................2-3hp

hits........................4-5hp

injures.....................6-9hp

wounds......................10-15hp

mauls.......................16-21hp

decimates...................22-28hp

devastates..................29-38hp

maims.......................39-49hp

SAVAGES.....................50-62hp

CRIPPLES....................63-75hp

MUTILATES...................76-88hp

DISEMBOWELS.................89-99hp

* DISMEMBERS *..............100-120hp

* EVISCERATES *.............121-145hp

* MASSACRES *...............146-169hp

* PULVERIZES *..............171-199hp

** DEMOLISHES **............200-240hp

** EXTRIPATES **............241-269hp

** OBLITERATES **...........270-299hp

*** ERADICATES ***..........300-349hp

*** ANNIHILATES ***.........350hp+


I hope this is decent enough, I only spent about a half hour on it but I

wanted to give an example as to what I meant with the other damage tables

note I posted.  These damages are somewhat uniform with the caps, *'s etc

and if the cold/fire/acid/electric tables are made the same it would help

show a mage's damage comparible to a monks and so forth.

- Snog -

As for cold damage...


cools.......................0-7hp

chills......................8-16hp

numbs.......................17-30hp

blisters....................31-49hp

FROSTS......................50-74hp

FREEZES.....................75-99hp

* STIFFENS *................100-124hp

* HARDENS *.................125-159hp

* ICES *....................160-199hp

** SOLIDIFIES **............200-249hp

** PETRIFIES **.............250-299hp

*** CRYSTALLIZES ***........300hp+

Wake up call...~
Seltha~
Ok, we can wake/wake someone, but I think we should be able to wake with

socials too...  I mean if you're being jumped up and down on, or taken

advantage of, you're gonna be awoken and wanna see who your tormentor is.... 

so having a wake flag on socials for ones that can wake a person would be

cool...


For example: "slap"

Sleeping person view: "A sharp feeling of pain on your left cheek awakes

you, shaking the sleep from your eyes you find Seltha glaring down at

you." 

Initiating point of view: "Glaring at Bob, you slap him hard, awaking him

from his slumber." 


Socials I feel should wake you: bonk, bounce, brag, caress(?) cheer,

clasp, comb, comfort, cough, cry, curse, dance(?), drool(?), faint,

flail(?), flip, french, gloat, greet, growl, hkiss(?), hug(?), jump,

kiss(?), lick, massage, noogie, nudge, pat, pinch, poke, prod roar,

ruler, scold, scratch, scream, shake(hand), shriek, sing, slap, snap,

snarl, sneeze, spank, swear, tackle, tantrum, taunt, thank(?), thump,

tickle, twiddle, all forms of whap, whine(?), yodel.

I am prepared to write all these wake up socials, if you will provide the

code for which to do it :) 


Also, someone yelling in the same room that you are sleeping should wake you.

hello~
Zephyr~
I was wondering why a mage at higher level could not leech the energies

from ther famliars ei hp or mana whilst in battle, since it is one of the

greatest reasons for a mage to gain a familiar, jsut a thought 

--

Actually, mages classically have familiars for two reasons, neither of

which is to steal their personal energies for their own.  The first

reason is to have the familiar be their eyes and ears, watching out for

the wizard with their (sometimes) enhanced senses.  Secondly, mages more

oft than not spend the bulk of their time alone, researching new spells,

making magic items, etc, and familiars are oft their only friends and

companions during these lonely times - of course, anyone else would

disturb their studies.  While in times of _great_ need, a familiar might

allow its energies to be used by its master or a mage might impose on its

companion for help, in most cases, doing so would threaten the familiars

life.  And regardless how easy familiars are to get in the game (ie one

per level), putting them at such risk is not something a mage would do.


Sure, it might be cool that familiars substitute as free, instant chia

pets that can do battle with you, but their main functions are to be

scouts and companions.  With switch currently broken, the former is not

possible, so I'm afraid everyone will have to be content with the latter.

For the time being at least.

Topic:Thryis

Worshipers: Dwarves of Lawful-Good Alignment

Appearance: Thryis appearse as a young warrior dressed in armor of Ethrial light and carrying a mystical axe of Purety.

.........................................................

Thryis is the God of Balance and Power, Any dwarf who swares his servises

to thyris must first compleat a quest of worth, only those of Lawful-good

and Dwarven decent may follow thyris.  If the Dwarf is so gifted as to

pass the test of worth he will behonored through out the dwarven comunity

and Thryis will present this dwarf with t"The Axe of Iron Mountain".  The

Axe gives +1 dam against evil beings but must never be used against

innocent lives as the result would be catostrophic.  the disadvantages to

following Thryis are, Poverty as aall the money gos to the poor and

needy, water movment is doubled and the killing of innocent beings would

result in aoutmatic exspulsion.

Axe of Iron mountain: stats are simler to those of the Notched Falachion

Generic object term~
Gyre~
If I want to drop a single reagent, I can just type 'drop reagent'.  No

matter what the actual name of the reagent is, it'll drop it.  Same with

armor, weapon, and food.  But what if I want to drop one of anything, no

matter what it is.  For example, I have a bag full of stuff I want to

sacrifice.  At the moment, there is no easy way for me to get and drop

those items, because they are not of a single 'type'.  And I don't want

to 'get all' because that would just be a helluva lotta spam, and you

can't sacrifice all anyway.  Would it be possible to add another

pseudo-object type named 'item'.  So if I typed 'get item' it would get

one of something...  anything.  Such as 'get item from bag', or 'get item

from corpse'.  It is just meant to be an alternative to 'all', for the

few situations where all doesn't work, in particular 'sacrifice'. 

'sacrifice item' would be somewhat easier to use.

Charge (or ram) would be a higher level warrior skill that works similar

to bash only is 500% more effective.  With bash's current state, nobody

in their right mind would spend pracs on it.  Bash only works one in

every ten times on even the simplest of creatures.  Charge would have

bash as a preq and would work a lot better even on larger mobs.  If a

warrior slammed into a cow (unbashable by many races) it would be sure to

fall over, as would many other large creatures.

Idea:Social Switches ?

social -s (returns socials you can do even in sleep)

social -m (returns socials you can do even in meditation)

social -r (returns socials you can do even in rest)

social -f (returns socials you can do only when standing on your feet.)

social -a (returns socials which are aggressive (if/when this works (again?) .)

social -r (returns socials which reveal you when hiding.)

social -d (returns socials which disrupt casting.)

Hunger and Thirst and their affects..~
Seltha~
Aside from stopping your move regen and stuff, they don't have any bad

affects, my thought was that as you get hungrier and thirstier you become

weaker and less able to perform so when You are hungry.  and/or You are

thirsty.  then you lose 1 con and str And so on down to You are startving

to death!  and/or You are dying of thirst!  Where you should be down by

about 5 str and 5 con After eating it should wear off like lingering

touch of death...

Languages.~
Belgar~
I think the present language system makes roleplaying excessively hard.


Yes, it's realistic, maybe.  But stopping 1st level characters who live

in chiiron from talking to each other in character means they start using

tell to communicate.  If you want to be an elf, and talk to a human, you

need to spend 12 pracs getting human to 7, and even then you get garbled

communication.  Where's the incentive to talk in character, and not just

use tell for everything?  When you consider that six races start in

chiiron, learning enough languages to talk to them is basically

impossible at low levels.  It worries me that at 1st level, you're taught

to basically learn humanic to 1, introduce to people, then use tell. 

After all, it screws your development over to learn languages.  The few

people who arrive, decide to learn languages, and try to talk to other

people get told to use tell, because it's so much more convenient.


Conclusions:

* trying to communicate in character is a major disadvantage, especially

at low levels.


Possible solutions:

* a common tongue, which newbies start off with level 10 in.  give them

their native language as well.

* make languages irrelevant to say.  instead, make shopkeepers know

languages, and affect shop prices by how well you speak their tongue, so

elves get keen prices in vaasa.

Trance~
Fingolfin~
Make a special message for trance.  Different from meditate one anyway. 

It's a different skill.  Something like: 

Fingolfin kneels down, closes his eyes, and goes into a trance.

Or something like that, you Imms are better at writing that stuff than

me, but you get the idea.

sheep shears~
Kwee~
could you have the Sutler in Pennan sell sheep shears?

You'd think with a whole community clothed in wool,

their sheep would be a little easier to get wool off of.

(0 for around 30 sheep so far)


Kwee, who'd rather just cut the wool off then decimate the sheep population

Re: Belgar - another solution~
Grimsza~
A much better solution would be to have races start in their own towns,

as seems to have always been the unfulfilled intention.  Why is this not

done now?  Because most of the towns need some building done before it

would be fair to non-humans.  And yes, I know the current builders have

plenty to do already.

Still, I gotta ask, why are we getting new areas built when the old ones

still need to be completed?

And, I gotta point out, most of the work required is very straightforward

stock building, and there are no shortage of builders lined up at the

door asking for work.

Finally, partial implementation of this would be a lot better than no

implementation.  Vaasa, Brithbaraad, and Sos-Kul in particular are nearly

ready for this now, starting Elves Orcs and Lizards off in their own

towns would be a great start, the other races could continue to start in

V-Town and Chiiron until their homes are ready.  It would still be a big

step in the right direction.

I would very much like to see the amount of eq in the city expand.  I was

looking over the list of items at the weapon shop, for example, and found

thier best weapon to be a bronze longsword.  Like I said, I'm not

demanding immediate action, or any action at all, really.  Just would

like to see our shops have a wider selection so I don't have to buy the

slightly inferior human goods.

armor~
Antoine~
a lizardman asked how a cloak was when i logged into tfe today

he was getting flmamed about not using an ic channel, and about how you arent' suppoised to get stats on anything over pub channels.

there should be a list of to look at in shop that tells you how an item compares with another, BEFORE you buy the item.

at least than it would save inocent newbies from being flamed because they dont' want to waste all of their money on an acessorie they don't know will work or not.

Perhaps give the shopkeepers in the armor shops, and weapons shops soeme extra dialog, where you can ask them about cloaks, shields, leggings, torso armor, etc, etc, on then you receive a list,

of all of each location's armor, and each type of weapon, in order from the best, to the leasest.

P.S. i hope this note  wasn't too difficult to read, cuase i'm using telnet and don't have the ability to backspace.

Request~
Gyre~
Perhaps you should make an Imm/Ava command called 'answer'.  They type

'answer player' and it automatically marks the request as filled.  If

there are multiple requests, perhaps 'answer player for reason where

reason is tested against the text in the requests that player has made.

For example:

request ava I need approval, thx

request imm I'm stuck in jail because of a bug.

Grayclaw types:

answer Gyre

Error message: Ambiguous, please specify the request you are answering.

answer Gyre for jail

Avatar types:

answer Gyre

Since the avatar only sees Avatar requests (I assume), it is unambiguous

to them.  In any event, since Grayclaw answered the previous request, it

was automatically removed from their request list anyway.

Denounce.~

The ability to denonce your religion..  lets say you wanted to leave your

current deity but refrain from choosing a new one.  That way people who

become frustrated with their gods can temporarily be completely without

one, at least till they next sacrifice and choose a new god..  having no

god could give penalties (lack of spells for clerics/paladins etc) not to

mention the inability to pray..  would mostly be an rp thing.

than ligh races, mostly due to the elven village and gnomish picnic..  I

haven't noticed many mobs with dark grievances, so heres some of my

suggestions for mobs that could give nation grievances.


Small goblins near kha-da

Goblins in the Eerie caverns

Pennan mercs

Orc Raiders

The wraithlords/sentinel/prince in vyans (If Harand-da is clanned, why not?)

Voaleth palace mobs (if they arent already clanned)


A few light mobs I've noticed who shold have grievances too.

The duellist (He's an elf-type of great renown and skill)


If people mudmail/tell me mobs/areas they think should be on the list,

I'll be happy to add them.
