Cursed items~
Orb~
I didnt see the cursed message when I equipped a no.remove item.

wearing items with +stats.~
Nivel~
For instance, I wear an object that gives me +hps, but when I quit and

relogin, it only gives me my nat hp, and if I take that object off, it

takes off those hps.  eg.  I wear a +3000hp body armor(seems excessive

but helps) and when I wear it I have around 4.5khps, when I quit and

relogin I only keep the 1.5khps, and the and when I take it off, I'm down

to 1hps, since it can't go any lower.  The problem can be solved by

reversing the process, but it should be fixed regardles.

Hand Items~
Jimbalaya~
no.shield should make an item take up both hands.


The shield skill likely doesn't work now that there is no shield wear

position, maybe a shield flag should be put in to trigger teh shield

skill.


Offhand will probably need to be adjusted now that you can wield a second

weapon without the offhand skill.

Directions in rextras~
Starshine~
Code isn't checking rextra keywords when you type look <direction>

Or at least it returns "You see nothing of interest in that direction."

whether it exists in rextras or not.


@C==

This is very very strange.  Directions in rextras don't seem to be

working in one of the my areas, but they ARE working in my two other

areas...haven't figured out why yet.  The only difference between the

former and the latter is that the former was created before the latter

areas.

ask w/o target trigger~
Florian~
Using a tell trigger w/o a target lets you use is_name OR to interpret

ANYTHING that the pc _tells_ an npc to return the same thing.  Can the ask

trigger be made the same way?  As it is, asking a mob in a fashion to

make ANY asked response turn up the same thing does not work.

class table~
Phule~
cannot set certain flags ( like chaotic evil align ) because is processed

as another flag ( like chaotic good align ).  Perhaps change names to

chaotic.evil, etc.

or, like in mflags, search for match first, etc.

anyways....

add ofind flag~
Phule~
for layer. ofind -l ?

perhaps for level also, ofind -L 50 gives you items over 50.

so ofind -W sword -L 50 gives you swords over 50, ofind -w neck -l top -L

!20 gives you all top-level neckwear under level 20.

is_player~
Orb~
Hmm, this isnt working in acodes.  I triggered a mob's attack code with a

room code with an entering trigger.  I looped all in the room to do an

area attack, then designated that only players should be hit.  The mobs

went crzy and hit everything in the room.

summon~
Adakar~
Currently the summon code for mobs does not seem to be functioning.  The

mobs appear to go through the coding but they dont actually summon the

other mobs to them.

minor bug~

sweep isn't working, was a nice little command.

~
895708190
few bugs~
Nivel~
@b@C->@n Has_obj doesn't look for objects outside of inv, like worn eq.

I'm assuming junk_obj works similarly.

@b@C->@n goto <room name> still doesn't work.


These might be repeated bugs, but I figure I'll post em anyway, just in

case they aren't obvious.  Others may follow.

bad capitalization in acodes~
Rue~
This seems to only happen when using color codes.


The output:

a drunken off-duty orc pushes the wooden beads aside with a soft clatter.


The string:

@G$n pushes the wooden beads aside with a soft clatter.@n

'east of the waterfall'~
Merolen~
I type 'enter waterfall', and get no response at all.


@ywaterfall is not the keyword you need, but it should say something like

'you don't see that to enter' or something like that.  --Fenlyn@n

get all + hidden objects~
Florian~
Typing get all reveals hidden objects.  Should be totally hidden, I'd

hope.

Barding and Saddlebags~
Rue~
Can't put them on your horses with this syntax:


put barding on stallion

returns: Syntax: put <obj> [in] <container>.


and put barding stallion

returns: You can't put in a slender black stallion.

Has_obj doesn't check~
Talis~
has_obj doesn't check wielded items it seems.  I have a few mobs that

have weapons load equiped on them, and a has_obj in their mpcode turns up

negative in such cases.


@g- - - - -@n

Would be really good if has_obj considered wielded objects.  Then a mob

with a shortsword special attack could atually implement it when it had

the shortsword.  As it stands now, I'd have to load some strange object

into their inventory whenver the shortsword loaded and check for it to

trigger the shortsword attack.  This means, all normal mobs that check

for the equiped item are generating wimpier experience and seem far

wimpier tan they are.


Kind of odd when a bare-handed level 4 mob is doing the same damage as

its armed level 6 guardian.

re: avatar of ss'trasa~
Keethrax~
When you do 'get statue' in 'The Holy Shrine of Sst'rasa', the statue

hits you once, but you don't enter combat.

Using attack functions in codes to draw mobs into combat isnt working.

has_obj problems~
Florian~
There is a very minute chance that if you spam something to activate a

code that has a has_object check that it'll check as being true,

regardless of you having (or ever having had ) the object.  (minute as in

very very very slim - i think its usually the first time the program has

been run per boot...but can happen afterward too.) 


Also, if there is a crash, if gets rid of no.save items (as should be) -

the side affect is that if a program calls for a has_object check and the

character had the item before crash but no.save wiped it out, sometimes

it'll still show the character as having it and has_item will read true.

@C*Florian@n

Objects vs. Room.~
Nivel~
I think Room descriptions should come before object description.  For

instance, when I type look ring, I look at the ring I have, and I can't

look at the ring in the rextra.  Same when I tried to look at a stream. 

Perhaps this could be fixed.

Hallucinate~
Rag'nor~
when you drink the water in the Rabbit Warrens that is in the roomwith

the DWarf wizard you see colors...  Okay...I am now halluciating and on

scan I see all of the Neato stuff...but when I "look" in the room I see

what is there ie...I see a dwarf wizard...

897671102
no.show + obj desc first?~
Florian~
If you have an object with no.show, chances are its used a LOT.  Like

river items, pools, etc.  But they Didnt always have to have the same

description.  If the item desc didnt match the room it was going in, you

could mask it with a room extra decription, so you didnt have to make a

new object every time.  Such is no longer the case because an item's desc

takes precident over the rooms desc.  Bug or feature?  If feature, then

the only way to correct is to write acodes if you dont want to make new,

unnecessary items that just do the same as other no.show items.

Clacking in fear, [BUG] releases a honey-sweet odor into the air.

--

After the first couple of lines of code, no MATTER if you re-define the

mob with a mob = mob_in_room( mob, room ); string, act_messages such as

act_tochar( #string, ch, obj, mob ) will still turn up [BUG] in place of

$N.

Is_follower mostly broken~
Florian~
is_follower function is broken, more or less, making a lot of entering

acodes duplicate their actions.  NOt to mention just about any other

reason you need it for.

acodes~
Fenlyn~
Have a code in my office (84) that takes all the coins out of the

turnstiles on the ground and junks the coins.  My screen displays my

junking the coins before I actually get the coins out of the turnstiles.

It uses interprets to get the coins and an interpret to junk all.coin.

It is aedit 2 in rm 84.

lilypads and white lily flowers~
Servius~
When a lilypad had a flower on it, when you walk into a room it would

display it in a fasion of adding another line after the lilypad indented

saying: On a lily pad: a white lily flower.  This was quite important

because when you go to look in lily pads, it says they aren't a container

thus there is no way to know if there is a flower on one.

Chant~
Fenlyn~
When you chant you see "You chant: blah blah" and then on the next line

you see "Fenlyn chants: blah blah." Also, when an invis imm chants, it

says someone instead of "Someone" with a capital letter.  Also, you can't

type chant on and chant off to toggle chant.  I guess you could still use

opt chant, but where's the fun in that?
