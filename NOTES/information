Names~
Merior~
Those of you wondering, many 'old' names are being used by different

people.  When we are officially opening, those wanting their 'old' names

back get first pick.  Many of the notes you have seen posted by folks you

know are actually written by the imposters.

Just for general info: if you're finding you can't light a torch, try

holding it and igniting it in a room with something hot, like a fireplace

Webpage~
Aeneas~
Okay, here goes.  I have started a TFE webpage.  Here's the address:

www.geocities.com/Paris/Cafe/5470/Forests.html Inside there is a little

info about my TFE experience, as well as my two main characters pre-wipe. 

However, there are several other categories i would like for your help

with.  I will try to record the old clans, as well as those new ones

which shall arise.  I have a player section, so if you would like to send

me a bio of your character, and the whereabouts of a decent pic, if

possible, i would be more than happy to represent him/her on the page.


There will also be a section on Gods, Towns, Races, and Imms, (should

they like to submit any info).  Please glance at it, and make any

comments.

PK manifesto~
Pulchit~
Let it be known that I have officially left OOPK.  I have done this for

two reasons: I have inadvertantly killed two OOPK members in the past,

and my good friend, Sa'fach, has been expelled from OOPK and is now

hunted by the clan.

This note has two purposes: To clear up some miscommunication that

happened in the past, and clear up what will happen during the time

between now and the next Pwipe.

Let's make it really clear, right now.

In the recent past, I have been criticized by many for my PK activities. 

For those who care, I have a RP reasonfor doing so, and will post about

it on the stories board.

I do not PK out of spite, nor out of greed or because I like being a

bully.  The simplest reason for it is that I enjoy chaos and a good

challenge.  When I PK, I want to see if I can create enough fear to get

100% of the people I hunt to either cower in terror or log off, OR I want

to see if they will organize a resistance group and kill me in return.

Valiant has killed me twice, in fair fights, and I applaud his efforts in

doing so.  I see his actions as the ideal response to my actions.  When

people try to harrass me either through channels or tells, they don't

actually accomplish anything except amuse me and convince me to kill them

more often.

...

There is one thing I don't like about PK.  That is, I've killed many of

my friends, and they tend to not like it much.  I understand the anger at

losing levels or a character, and I have felt them too.  However, I think

that it is mostly a waste of energy and time to get too worked up about

characters that will be deleted soon anyway.

It is on this point that I end my note: The person that gives me my 9th

death will inherit ALL of my stuff, and my entire bank balance in homage. 

I hope this has cleared up some miscommunication on the subject, and I

hope I haven't alienated too many friends.

FWI~
Steele~
Since I just read a note in which Fenlyn said he didn't know what

filtering was: Filtering is a new command that allows you to block out a

specific person.  You do not see tells...oocs....gos...anything said on a

public channel by that specific person.  However: much like ignore people

can still reply lock around a filter.  This is probably to keep people

from using the fact that a certain person can't tell to them to thier

advantage.  Like me filtering Griffin and cussing him out without his

being able to send a tell back to me to get even.

Multiple pet problem.~
Hoel~
If you have more than one pet of a given type and would like them to show

up on look and scan properly, look at one of htem.  This seperates it

from the 'pack'.  Repeat this n-1 times, where n is your number of pets.

PK and healing mobs~
Pulchit~
I was just wondering if healing mobs in a PK room was kosher or not.

Anything goes in a pkill zone, just don't swear at other players and

remember it is a game to be enjoyed.

Note that there is a space at the end of the first line.


I like this better than prompt cleric, because I don't need to change my

prompt when I run solo, and it includes directions in it.  The leader's

hits are marked in light cyan and the enemy's hits are marked in dark red.

Just something I found~
Caitria~
I found this on the web a while ago and have been meaning to post it. 

Thought you all might get a kick out of it.


-Friends Without Faces-

We sit and we type and we stare at our screens,

We all have to wonder what this possibly means.

We chat with each other, we share all our woes,

Small groups we do form and gang up on foes.


We wait for someone to type out our name,

We want recognition and offer the same.

We give kisses and hugs and sometimes we flirt,

Through tells we chat deeply and say why we hurt.


We form friendships but why is a thing we don't know,

Though most often cease, some will flourish and grow.

Why is it we share those deep thoughts in our mind,

With those we can't see, as though we were blind?


The answer is simple, as clear as a bell,

We all have our problems and need someone to tell.

We can't tell "real" people, but tell someone we must,

So we turn to the computer and to those we can trust.


Even though it is crazy, the truth still remains,

They are friends without faces and with odd little names.

~
896615739
Bannable Offenses~
Adalus~
(1) Ranger/Cleric abandoning tamed/zombie pets that become aggro in a

public place so they attack newbies/etc.  If you must abandon a pet, you

must abandon it someplace safe then kill it yourself immediately.


(2) People using their pets as tanks with pet.assist and autoassist off. 

You are placed in a situation where you are not at risk, and therefore is

not proper.


(3) Killing of any sanctuary mob by means of bugs or 'circumventing' the

sanctuary by any means.


(4) Killing any mob in any situation where you are not placed at any risk

by any means.  If you can kill something without it attacking you or a

player in your group, then it's a bug.


(5) If you're killing something and it seems too good to be true, it

probably is and you should report it.


(6) Publicly swearing on any channel repeatedly, refusing the direction

of an immortal or avatar.


(7) Healing a mob while someone is killing it.


Will post more as they come across...  If you know of some more please

MUDmail me.

Autoskinning Triggers~
Varro~
It seems some people are still clueless as to how to make a skinning

trigger.  Don't make it on the "So-and-so is DEAD!!" line, because that

makes you steal corpses from other people occasionally.  Make it on the

"You receive %1 experience" line.  If you miss a corpse, manually skin

it, it isn't hard at all.  @R-Varro

Rock this way.~
Denzar~
Keystroke mudder, never grouping with another

Till I talked to your clan, and they say

They said, "You ain't killed nothin' till you've just kicked the stuffin'

outta things when our boys lead the way."

So I got with their grouping, was a real fun trooping

Oh, the levels we could tear to bits

'Cause the best things of muddin' with the magin' and the sluggin'

Only started when the clan admits

like this!


Easy group killin' with the boys in the clan

and their spells flyin' up in the air

Singin' "Man this is easy"

With the group in the middle of the zone

Like it wasn't there

So I took a big chance, and I joined in their rants

With a fool who was ready to flame

Didn't know what I was sayin'

'Cause the clan had me playin'

and they knew I was in to stay

and they told me to


Rock this way, talk this way

Rock this way, rock this way

Rock this way, rock this way

Rock this way, talk this way

Just gimme my kits

Like this!


They think that we suck and we level through luck

'Cause we type with the easier keys

There were three loud mudders on the OOC channel

when I noticed they was laughin' at me

They said I was a loser, like the rest of my clan

and that our charter and players was lame

I knew they was wrong, cause their words was so long

and our clan is the best in the game,

go away!

Question re: bug abuse.~
Grimsza~
Just wondering..  since call does not work right now, is killing

shopkeepers considered bug abuse or not?


***

Yes, it is bug abuse.

Rue

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Thank you for clarifying that.  It brings to mind another question I am

almost afraid to ask, but..  does that mean killing other mobs that would

normally call for help is also bug abuse?  Sheep for instance?

I mean..  I didn't feel like I was abusing a bug to get that wool..  if

call had worked it would have only meant I had to kill the sheepdogs too.. 

which I could do..  I guess I am just trying to figure out where the line

is set..  I want to be sure that I am not breaking any rules and

sometimes the line seems a little difficult to find.


***

Use common sense.  Please.

Addicted to Muds.~

You got yourself onto the 'net

Picked up things from folks you met

And then one day, you found a game

And ever since, you ain't the same


You don't eat, you don't sleep

There's no doubt that you're in deep

Your mudding ways tie up the phone

With all your friends, you're all alone


Whoa-oh, you like to think that you're on top of the game, oh yeah

It's closer to the truth to say you're really pretty lame

You know you're gonna have to face it

You're addicted to muds


Tintin downloads, and zmud too

You autoscript the zones you do

Racing along, past all the rest

You are convinced that you're the best


A one track mind,

You play all day,

Immortalness is what you crave

If mobs are left for you to kill

You'll hack and slash to get your fill


Whoa-oh, you like to think that the gods will let you off, oh yeah

It's closer to the truth to say they've had enough

You know you're gonna have to face it

You're addicted to muds


Might as well face it, you're addicted to muds

Just pissed you off, you grab your gun


Woah-oh, you're gonna get them for not seeing your way, oh yeah

It's closer to the truth to say you've just gone insane

You know you're gonna have to face it

You're addicted to muds

And on and on~
Samantha~
Well, I'm back.  I got my computer fixed and can play now.  *hop* The

reason why I posted that earlier note was cause my mom decided to get my

modem line disconnected for the summer and I didn't want to fight my

boyfriend over who would get to be online.  But we got past that problem

and my parents' computer illiteracy by networking our computers.  So, for

anyone who thinks I was one of those people who pulled one of those 'I

hate TFE right now and I'm going to say I'm leaving only to be back in

two days when I can't find anything else to do' things, I'm not.  *grin*

For newbies.~
Caitria~
I think we all know TFE is a bit different from most muds and can take a

little time to get used to.  In my boredom, I ran into a file which could

help answer a lot of questions you may have.  It details what you should

do to help yourself become acquainted with the game and is relatively

easy to comprehend.  So if you are level 1 and extremely lost, read

@mhelp Starting@n.  Or you can always read it if you know what you are doing

but get bored enough.

skin trigger~
Grimsza~
This has caused a tremendous amount of bickering and ill-feeling, because

most people seem to be running around with unsophisticated skin triggers

that skin anytime something dies.

You are responsible for what your triggers do, if you can't set a trigger

that only skins your own kills you should turn triggers off.  Obviously

people aren't doin that however.

So just to make sure no one has an excuse (even a bad one) for this in

the future, here it is..  the skin trigger that only goes off for YOUR

kills.

Pattern: ^You receive * experience points.

Using this pattern instead of is DEAD!!  to trigger your skin will NOT

solve all the worlds problems, it won't even GUARANTEE that you never

skin someone elses kill, but it's a good start, and surely the least you

can do if you insist on using skin triggers.

Not that 99% of the mud cares but, I don't do pkill for any reason...  so

if you're a strong roleplayer and my not joining your group off players

in pkilling will cause IC problems later, just don't ask me.  That way,

every one can get along.

Legacy of the Seven Thunders~
Togashi~
Greetings Brothers.  I keep sending notes to the General Board but all

seem to end at the bottom.  Many of you may know of my plight to create a

clan.  And as I near level 20, I intend to get all the minor things

ironed out.


My clan is based on 7 heroes who managed to defeat an entire army

attacking Kha-da, and gave their lives for something they believed in.

I recently discovered my heritage and decided to re-new the memory of

these adventurers.  Their honor and courage should be celebrated in

recent heroes.


Restrictions -The fee is 2plat, when the stronghold is built, this fee

will be wavered.  Every allign above PN up to LG are allowed entry. 

There is no restrictions on class or Race . 


Benefits - Because of the Clan been headed by a cleric, summon will be so

much easier.  The clan will hopefully have portal crystal, clan just a

little distance away (similar to summon, only to clan stronghold) Also

there will be seven leaders, so that decisions will be made unitely. 

Each of the leaders will be best of their class, one mage, one paladin

that sort of thing.  There will be apprentices and also possible the

opportunity for competitions, just in the name of fun.


I won't write any more, your prolly bored already.  Don't be worried that

you won't fit in, we all need help now and again.

Lizardman Homepage up!  Info Wanted!~
Silas~
Attention, to all lizardmen!


As you were told in the note left by Locnar, (just 4 notes further down

the chart) a great project to bring all of the lizardmen back out of the

struggles that have plagued our past, and into a glorious future has

begun!


As the first step in this great project, I have designed and placed a

great document in the annuls of the world (the web).  I hope that, with

your help, I can put together a great historical and complete list of all

the wonderous lizardmen tribes that are still around.

We can work beyond our historical tribal warfare and be one race, united,

strong, and looking towards a glorious future!


I hope that every lizardman will look over this page and send me their

name, description, appearance, and the story of their color and tribal

heritage.


I hope this will also lead to the planned formation of a great and united

lizardman clan, to truly take our place as leaders on the Forest's Edge.


The web address is: http://members.aol.com/bryozoan/Lizardman.html


It is a work in progress, and hopefully will eventually include many

stories, pictures (hint), and links to the shadowlands lives (RL) places

of the lizardmen.


You can send questions and stories to me via mudmail or to : bryozoan(at)aol.com.

or to Locnar at : agent86(at)cats.ucsc.edu

To all Dwarves of TFE~
Kiirin Ra~
A few fellow members of our dwarven brotherhood have decided to create an

alliance of all dwarves among this realm.  As the ents and elves have

been given the Shuvanaguard, we too, would like a name for ourselves,

those of us who are true to the dwarven name, and hold our heads high.  I

have come in contact with Tirin, and he too believes in the same ideals. 

I am just asking you to send a small mudmail to me, if you would like to

support our beliefs, and/or devote some time into helping reach our goals.

@e@B-@R=@B-@R=@WGOALS@R=@B-@R=@B-

@e@G1: @WWe would like to create an equal to the Shuvanaguard, for all

dwarves of our land.

@e@G2: @WOur most important, and longterm goal, is to have every dwarf of

The Forest's Edge sharing in the same beliefs as we do, and supporting

our alliance at any costs.

@n

@e@RQuestions?@n

If you have any @Rquestions@n on anything I have mentioned, or you would

like to @Bacquire@n more detailed information, again all you need to do

is send a simple, and short, mudmail to myself.

I am known as @WKiirin Ra@n, a name given to me by the @WGods@n when our

nation had just begun to grow strong...

@n

For those of you who may be interested, have ideas, or are just curious I

have begun constructing a website, to give you more detail on our

movements.  The address will be posted soon.  Thanks.

Just something I've noticed but it seems a lot of people have this appearance:


A/An (adjective describing self) (race) with (adjective describing color) (color) eyes.


I can't say I didn't/haven't done this before but it would be nice to see some

original appearances.
