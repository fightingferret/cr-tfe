#NOTES

Requires_Climb~
Greyclaw~
Added a flag to dflags for use on exits that should require the climbing

or fly skill.  Also added a overloading ability to movement messages

which should allow cliffs to be done simply and well.

Pager/Ledit~
Greyclaw~
* Fixed pager to handle longer files and editor enforces new limit.

* Started ledit command - Welcome to look at it.

~
841939706
Searching~
Greyclaw~
* Added searching trigger to actions and made the search command use

on/off.  All searching acodes should now use that trigger instead of

overloading the command search.

842043743
Size Flags~
Greyclaw~
These are worth looking at.  Are very useful for making it impossible for

that dwarf to weild the giants hammar.  Also good for making armor not be

one size fits all.

~
842097409
Liquids~
Greyclaw~
The mud now adds the liquid to the end of a drink container.  A object

can have a known liquid or unknown in it.  If the liquid_known flag is

set it uses the real name and if not it uses the color entry of the

liquid table.  This flag tends to float around.  So if you fill a bottle

from a fountain the bottle inherits it from the fountain.  Therefore

"known" water sources such as chiiron fountain should have known_liquid

set as they know it is water and not just a clear liquid.  All drink

containers should no longer have afters and before of of beer or of

scotch.

842121864
Aggressive Pets~
Greyclaw~
Aggressive pets are no longer aggressive so is fine to have aggressive

mobs tamable IF it makes sense otherwise.  This is mainly for pets

growing.  So a baby wolf could grow into a big wolf.  The big wolf is not

tamable and aggressive - the baby wolf is tamable.

~
842220080
Skeletons/Zombies~
Greyclaw~
Fields in mstat are for the zombie or skeleton which is created when the

mob is animated.  Should be left 0 for mobs with no skeleton or zombie.

~
842228898
Starting Table~
Greyclaw~
Entries for all races now - perhaps all goblins should know climb or

something.

~
842230164
Food/A-Flag~
Greyclaw~
Added +A flag to resets for a silly lizard - type help reset.

Food now can be raw, cooked or burnt.

If you don't want it to be any of these set value1 to -1.

If an fire object is in the room players can "cook" food.

~
843294978
Rowhere/Actions~
Greyclaw~
Add close trigger on exits - same as open.

Target field in action now looks up in command table the standard minimum

length for a given command if a normal command so 1 east can now just be

east.

rowhere -p and rmwhere -p work.

~
844210071

Greyclaw~
Made mobs with predator flag attack sleeping players.

~
846884454
Hbug~
Greyclaw~
Added Hbug Command for tacking things onto help files.

Liquid in a liquid container is now set in the reset so we need only ONE

type of barrel.

~
847557138

850511097
Ban/Socials~
Greyclaw~
* Ban has been modified to allow banning of phule without banning all of

purdue.

* If the line of a social begins with ! it is seen even if the person

cannot see the socialite.  For example some of the lines of cough should

begin with a ! while none of those of smile should.

* Pet prices are being used.

oedit replace <v1> <v2>~

Mass replace of reset vnums for objects so I can more easily replace all

the silly <metal> <armor> objects.

~
870460633
Woodworms~
Talis~
Their aim has improved with their acid spray attack.  (Meaning it

actually works now) So don't be surprised when it hurts like it was

always supposed to.

~
873374398
corrections~
Merior~
-- ogre strength now increases your strength a maximum of 3 (to cap of

17) 

-- blind fighting now actually does something (it appears it was never

coded *blush* ) 

~
874342489
invis vs invisibility~
Talis~
Invis and Invisibility are object flags.  You can't make invisible

objects, because attempting to toggle the invis flag defaults to toggling

the invisibility flag (which makes the player invisible when they use the

item in question).  Maybe rename invis to is.invis so it doesn't confuse

the flags?

  

While at it, maybe make all the is.  and is_ into one format?  So we

don't have to check oflags every time we need to determine, is it

is.chair or is_chair.


Re: Flags now check for exact match and failing that a partial match so

problem 1 should be gone.

~
876359215
Rtables~
Greyclaw~
* Added rtwhere command.

* Fixed renumbering problem with rtables.

* Generally cleaned them up.

Added lock trigger to objects.

My pet wolf wanted to be about to eat corpses so added carnivore flags

for mobs.  Allows them to eat meat.

~
886602304
Minor stuff~
Merior~
Sometime before we officially re-open, will rename a few boards

(General-IC and General-OOC and take out Wanted).  If there are minor

things like that you can think of, please let me know.  I am not going to

do any serious coding so as to stay out of GC's way, but can do trivial

stuff.

Reagent/trainer changes~
Florian~
*A lot of changes are being made to trainers and their rules for

placement.  (help trainer_placement) 

*Also, krynite pinches are no longer to be sold in shops.  They are now

custom item, made from a small fragment of krynite ore.  This ore can be

used as treasure in 30+ level areas, but please use caution.  Even minor

enchantment should be rare.

~
894767738
Cover Oflag~
Greyclaw~
Cover oflag causes objects worn underneath not to show when others look

at player.

~
895529263
Corpse~
Greyclaw~
Object type now has an int for decay time.  Also is not started at repop

- only when item is dropped, etc.

Added species to corpse objects ...  is used by skin and animate dead

command just in case you want to scatter "real" looking corpses.

~
895980731
Weight Func~
Greyclaw~
Add weight function.  Require a "thing" as argument which can be a

character, an object, or a room.  For any it return total weight in

hundreths of a pound.  For a room it is just total of contents.

~
896150899

Played with them.  See 30402 for an example.

~
897624208
Corpse weights~
Florian~
Corpse weights, it is my understanding, are now determined by the weight

of the mob, which is set in the mset field.
