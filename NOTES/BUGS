#NOTES

Tasloi vines.~
Belgar~
In room #38506, for example, if I leave north my pets don't follow, but

if I order them north I get '[BUG] doesn't seem to be able to use a vine

to swing north.  ' 

Second, if I whistle, the pets *do* come across the exit.

Shops~
Derjek~
Fiogis is closed, giving no light races the ability to custom armor, yet

Briths armor shop can custom to their hearts content.  Why can't Fiogis

just open a littly, and allow only bronze armor to be made at least?

Just wondering at the balance of things...

Re: Fiogis~
Orb~
No, he canot be opened because nothing in there works.  The one in

brithbarad hasnt been closed becuase I didnt know it existed :P As for

accusations that I "fixed that one first" it was unknown to me that it

was even there, sorry for not knowing one of the million and one details

this mud posseses.  I will close the brithbarad one and hope to have it

done sometime next week.  It is a very time consuming job, and I am rying

to find the consecutive hours to fix it.  Unfortuneately, I also have a

ton of other things to do, as well as a real life.  I am working on it,

and it will be done when its done.  Your patience is appreciated.

Attacking corpses?~
Badvok~
If a room contains a corpse such as "a corpse of the worker ant" and a

mobile of the same name, then "cast shock worker" reports "you cannot

cast shock on the corpse of the worker ant".  The solution is to junk the

corpse but it's a pain to do everytime.


---


Not that this is the solution you want but kill 2.ant will work also.

There's a new exit here going down, however it is inaccesible and it's

appearance is bugged when looking at it, attempting to enter it etc.

Stray pets?~
Nettle~
Is it a bug that my timberwolf seems to wander away

at the most inopportune times?

Well, I'm not really sure just when he wanders.

I just don't notice that he's missing until I need his help, heh.

re: cynthia's pit (I am cynth btw)~
Seltha~
I didn't wanna do 5 min relog modify the note then another 5 min relog so

here's the update...


Kay, where to start :)

I was mapping as Seltha earlier in the day, and Florian came along and

said Oi, what did I do to make the warning message turn up on his screen... 

He pinned it down to some code in the room south of #63534 (brithbarad

gates) Told me he fixed the code and wasn't sure what it did...  well

being the cautious persion I am, I remembered that Phule had been working

on the plains, and Phule being Phule you can't trust his code as far as

it will throw you ;) (no offence intended, I admire his code, but only

when it's not me being affected by it ;)) So anyways, I didn't go play in

that room (very glad I didn't)...


Well later on in the day, I was mapping now with Cynthia, areas I

couldn't go with Seltha (such as darkhaven), and curiosity killed the cat... 

I decided to check out that code :) I head to that room, walk in and die. 

I think to myself 'yup, that's Phule for you' :) Then I get all these

people asking how I managed to kill myself and think mmm, and this time

decide to check it out paying more attention :) So, after turing

incognito on, I walk back into the room (taking note of what happens),

and find that I get teleported immediately into a room with *no exits, no

description* (under construction) and a fall that MUTILATES you, and a

lioness...  mmm pain :) 


So I was just thinking you might wanna break that code again, since the

room is broken...  unless you were wanting a death trap *cough*

They try to bash you when you are on the ground already.  *shrug* minor

bug, thought I should mention it though.

Brazen is no longer agro.  not shure if this was a change or a bug

Talking to wandering NPCs~
Alana~
If you talk to the sage in Medienne, they can wander out of the room,

while talking to you...  This makes asking questions alittle awquard.  Is

there a way to stop him form wandering while talking to you?

Alana who can't walk fast enough to keep up with the old frail dude.

Gnomes~
Cylaria~
The corpse of a renegade gnome guard isn't a container. ??

could be a bug, wasn't sure

hmm... applies to other gnome renegades as well

~
899877418
Ja-rain.~
Brenna~
Something I noticed while killing him, nothing big:


The figure pulls back its hood, revealing a cruel, blue-white face with

jet-black eyes.  He opens his lipless mouth and shrieks, sending forth a

blast of wind.

A tall humanoid's freezing wind mauls you.


Would seem that a freezing wind might be more inclined to deal cold damage.

899883794
S'aark's personal bodyguard~
Snog~
I've been killing this mob a while now and it has become apparent to me

that he is more dangerous without a weapon.  Meaning, the damage he

inflicts on me is more when he uses his claws than when he loads with a

weapon.  My reasoning for this being a bug is the disarm ability.  This

skill needs to have more of a use than just because you need it for guard

or what ever the case might be.  Just seems really odd that a mob will do

mauls to me with a weapon and decimates when it does not wield a weapon.

- Snog -

cast create light~
Umraniya~
Now I have a bunch of green light that according to my equipment list is

floating near by and I have found no way whatsoever of getting rid of

them.  And they don't go away over time.

~
899892038
create light~
Hala Ioryn~
We all know work on this spell hasn't been completed yet, but I thought

this might still be worth pointing out: 


Each ball of light I create adds 1/100th of a pound to the weight total

at the end of my equipment list, although it does not alter the weight

totals on my inventory.


I suppose I could come up with a justification for this, but it seems

like it may not be intentional, as my balls of light don't _look_ like

they weigh anything.

~
899904322
pkill~
Jerryl~
When you walk in room #40269 and the mob has already been killed, you get

the message 'As you enter the room, you stumble into a sticky spider

web.' followed by 'You can't kill players here.' (i'm the only one in the

room anyways) 


/Jerryl\


@C==

This message always appears to players but it's the only way for the

spell to go off.

LIST OF KNOWN BUGS~
Alana~
This is a list of most of the current bugs known about and posted on this

board...  please read this before posting, so you don't re-post known

stuff.


OBJECTS.

Objects, items that don't just sit there, but are built to interact with

DON'T WORK, mostly.

Like: Bushes (can't pick, get, harvest)

Seeds (can't be planted etc)

Containers: liquid ones (don't tell how full)

Books don't work.

Mounts. (so things can't be put on them)

Money (some foreign coins)

Cursed equipment. (no message when you put it on)

Invisible things (are seen, to do with hide not working?)

Cook, Pick, bite, bash, rescue, junk


SKILLS/ACTIONS not working/not fully working

Cook, Pick, bite, Whistling(for pets), bash, rescue, junk

undo, kick, peek, appraise, hide, punch, and other thieve skills.

Can't snort snuff.

Some quests are buggy (some related to other bugs)

Grouping....  (autoloot, group following actions like jumping or entering

certain areas, split and group messages) 

Stringing commands together like movement with a buy/sell at the end. 

The action seems to happen before you get to the room required.

Autoloot

Sacrifice (can't do it with goods in inventory, need to drop them before sacrificing)

Autoscan in the desert (not showing all your group)

Some racial socials.

OPTION Wimpy.


SPELLS abit buggy...

(See complete list on the Announcement Board)

Shock (can cast it in a body of water like a pond)

Calm spell (when not in combat)

Animate dead/Greater animate (strange responses)


NPC NAMES.  If you look at them, you learn their names, but this doesn't

save.  Mainly because it would be a huge space filler as each player

would need their own file of which npc's they have looked at.


MOBS.  Seems some are having an aggro complex.  Some will attack and then

stop, some non-aggro are being aggro, some are assisting etc.


LIGHT. It don't work, this goes for the spell create light.


Hmm, I think that's most of it....this will be amended as time goes by.

feathers~
Slarskis~
should you put a feather on your head before a cap, or after a cap. 

Currently you have to put it on before the cap.  Is this backwards?

Queue~
Taeneth~
I have no idea if this has been posted, so here it is again if it has:


Cures are queued a lot longer than they used to be.  Or different,

somehow.  I don't like it and I know a lot of other clerics don't like it

either.  It's making our job a whole lot tougher than it already was. 

Cures should not be queued for more than a round unless you're sending

off more than the max per round.

~
899955242
Casting spells.~
Alana~
Before pwipe, you couldn't cast spells in the Chiiron bank...  so not to

spam other people in the room.  But now, you can.  Is that an oversight?

Plus all the other shops in Chiiron are Sanctuaries, but the bank isn't...

Is that how it's suppose to be?

Alana the spam hater..

His area attacks are only wounding me, not my pets.

Many area attacks bother only players, otherwise are likely to also injure

other mobs

899963528
Zombies~
Derjek~
I can skin Some zombies, like a hyena, and get bits of bone and rotting

flesh, but I can't skin corpses of boars or stags?  Surely their just all

one big dead family?

Why not be able to skin them all?

@GThis is personal preference on the part of the builder.  For certain

reasons, I needed all of my zombies and skeletons to do stuff like this. 

Whether or not the rest should be unskinnable or made partly useful is

probably up to their creator.

@C*@GF@Rl@Yo@Br@Yi@Ra@Gn@C*@n

--


On another tangent, I killed a timberwolf and within seconds cast animate

and got 'its too old to be animated' er.  too old?  Like I shoulda taken

1 second instead of 2?  Or if its age of the animal, should be a bit

clearer?

@GCheck its I.D.  next time.  Only corpses 50 years or younger can be

animated j/k.  No idea.

climb~
Grude~
now this may not be a bug....heh...but when did mountain rams start

climbing trees?  i just saw a litle durfie with not one but two of these

spectacular creatures up at the top of the vultures.  *boggle* 

@I

---

@I

probably because mud does not differentiate between 'can climb

mountainside' and 'can climb tree'.

hopfully work won't be put into that for quite some time :)

Re: web problem~
Servius~
I noticed it too.  When a mob is webbed, rewebbing of the mob does not

make any difference in changing how long the web lasts.  The mob breaks

free from the web only based on the first web and further webbing will

only have an affect after the mob breaks free.

Sub-monks~
Snog~
Are all the monks in the entire monestary suppose to come and help when a

sub-monk yells for help?  On scan, the mob was called "a monk" not the

monk guard in the sub-monk zone.  Now when I scan after fleeing, I see..

north : two monks, a monk guard, four strongly muscled monks

Now I'm gonig to leave before I get myself killed.

Hit-regen items.~
Belgar~
These items still give half as much + regeneration as an identify scroll

shows them to.


@yThat's odd.  It should give you 10% of displayed vallue.  --Fenlyn@n


Er, whoops. I mean:

An item with a hit-regen displayed of 10 gives +0.5 regen, while an item

with mana-regen displayed of 10 gives +1 regen.

login~
Sailis~
When you mistype your character name at the log in prompt, you get a

little paragraph about things that you may have done wrong.  The last

sentence of this paragraph reads: " After having done that and received

email containing the confirmation code go to option 2 and being the

process of creating a character." I may have had too much to drink

tonight, but I think the word 'being' should actually be 'begin'.  Just

goes to show how many people really read menus and room descriptions and

all that sort.  :D

Corpse/befriending bug~
Kierthos~
Whilst strolling to my favorite "snack on the run" place, I noticed a

corpse of Sardon lying on the ground.  Seeing that it was empty of all

gear, I decided to attempt to pick it up.  Lo and behold, I could!

Here's the problem:

(1) To the best of my knowledge, I am not befriended to Sardon. 

Therefore, I should not be able to pick up his corpse.


(2) If this part of the code is buggy, then other code relating to

corpses may be buggy too.  *shrug* 


(3) Finally, Sardon's corpse only weighed 0.95 pounds.  I know gnomes are

small, but this is ridiculous...


For purposed of documentation, I am going to store the corpse in my bank

account.  (viewing of the corpse is between noon and 6 pm, EST)

Strike that...  appears that the bank is refusing bad meat these days.

Spiderman can web, Why cant I?~
Razu~
I'm just darned sick of seeing this message all in one round.


The web trapping a wisteria vine thickens.

(*a few hits from group*)

A wisteria vine breaks through the web holding it.


It seems to me if we all have web at 10 this should not be happening.

It's an utter waste of webs, and they're annoying to gather

Please either fix the thickening to cancel out a break out

message coming in the same round or make web a reagent-less

spell


@g- - - - -@n

As annoying as this is, imagine what it must be like to be coding a mud.

Add to this all the ungrateful little gits that whine no matter just how

much you fix or improve.  I think a little patience is in order.  If it

annoys you too much I see two options:

Quit or quit and do it yourself.  :P

Honestly I think we have enough problems with higher priority than a

simple little spell that at least has an effect.  Or is it preferable to

die to a bug several times and argue with the imms over whether or not to

be reimbursed yet have a working low level spell?

==========================

I agree there a lot of problems with higher priority, I expect

you havent read drog's note on the general board, it has some

info on imm/player relations. Ok fine I'd like to report that

switch and auction and pick and follow dont work :p

Gods~
Derjek~
Reading help religion, then help <gods name> specifically, what the heck

are Dwarves supposed to follow?  According to the files, dwarves tend to

follow Kerog, but the help file reads no goods may follow him.  Okie,

acceptable , okie, i'll follow the Other god, Kantos, god of mountains

and earth, sounds Dwarfy?  But, it reads that he only attracts Neutral

people, as they see his philosophical differences.  *cough* many dwarves

are good, leaving us to follow pansy gods like Cynnis and co.  What, oh

what, has happened to the typical dwarf loony, fighting against

everything for the good of the land?  I mean, as Chaotic good, i want to

fight against evil and will break the law if i have to, and go to extreme

lengths.

So, can you extend the gods aligns slightly?  I'd love to be a cleric

with a suitable god.


@yWe are working on redesigning the religions system and the religions

within the system.  That's about all I can tell you for now.  --Fenlyn@n

Blind Fighting~
Grimsza~
help blind fighting says:


The result of this is that they are able to hit their opponents more

accurately and with more power.


However it seems to only help with accuracy, not with power.  Possibly

the help file needs to be updated, possibly the skill is bugged, possibly

something else, just thought I would mention it.

green ball of light~
Daelin~
I'm not sure that this is a bug, but it seems a bit weird, so I'm reporting it,

just in case. I died and one of the random items that stayed on my corpse was a ball

of light created from the create light spell...when I loot the corpse it is now in my

inventory. I can't rewear it either, no big loss of course, but I don't think it was

intended.

Gaol in Kha-da~
G'Narrl~
Hi all...  I just want to report a possible bug...  I was in the alter in

Kha-da happily sacrificing stuff to My goddess Algesa when I was grabbed

and put into the Gaol for no possible reason I can think of...  I think

the exact syntax prior to the imprisonment was "get all silk" meaning get

all items from silk bag in order to sacrifice it...  Unless the gold pile

has the keyword silk, then this imprisonment is not just...  I just want

to report this as a possible bug and hopefully some kind imm will let me

out of prison...  BTW how long until they let you out?  (probably never

is my guess) *sigh* G'Narrl 

---

using GET in this room will get you imprisoned right now.  is a bug that

you can't get out.  NONE of the timed triggers like that are currently

Seems to be buggy. Drog cast it and said I did not detect as evil.

id says: Sex: male     Alignment: neutral evil

Possibly this bug (whatever it is) has something to do with why I keep

Rabbit Warrens~
Cecil~
When I scanned just south of 'Warren Tunnels - By A Crevice' (east of

dwarf mage) where 'The tunnel has caved in, and you can not go that

way.', I could see two rabbits north of me, passed the caved in wall.


Moments later, both rabbits (one at a time over about a minute) arrived

from the north, indicating that to the north, to exit is unlocked, while

from the south, is is locked but not opaque.

stalked by light~
Vivictus~
I spammed create light for lots of time to get it to lev 7 for create water.

Now I am being followed by at least a couple hundred balls of light.

Rue already checked it out and said it was a code problem.

Rue says (in primal): "is a code problem"

Rue says (in primal): "post a bug note"

I hope this can be fixed without much difficulty.

Priestess in Chiiron~

I just practiced some stuff with the priestess in Chiiron, and when I

handed her the money for her fee all it said was "You hand 5 sp."....not

you hand it to someone or anything like that.

'Wear' weight bug~
Stol~
Ok, I've got a furred waterskin of soup that weighs 7.6 lbs according to

my inventory screen.  It's the only item i'm carrying, so my total carry

weight is 7.55 (I'm guessing this is the actual weight and the 7.6 is

rounded).  Anyway, when I hold the waterskin, my total carry weight goes

down to -.05, it subtracted the rounded weight instead of the actual

weight.

Alingment Changes!~
Catintallus~
I have been attempting to talk to an immortal for the last couple of days

and I would like something done about this.  I created Catintallus as a

Chaotic Neutral charactor and found out the hard way the he was no longer

CN.  but CE on checking my other charactor I found that his alingment has

also changed from CG to CE (Kalgart) While the change with Kalgart isn't

too much of a problem - I was really playing him that way, The change in

Catintallus is very annoying as I have no wish to play him as CE ! Also I

noticed this on wandering through Chirron - And being killed.


mud mail or Email me on this one plaese as no imm's seem to be on when I

can logg in 


Catintallus


@yHmmm.  Seems you have been attacking a Chiiron guard recently.  And you

wonder why you are CE now?  --Fenlyn@n 

@yOr were you CE before entering the town?

Item Quantity bug~

You buy four empty large canvas bags from a shopkeeper for 911 cp.

Somehow, I don't think 1 equals four.  Stop me if I'm wrong.  :)

The blue arcs of energy charge a rabbit. mostly dead

Two rabbits is stunned, but will probably recover.

A human mage's swing mauls a rabbit's cottony tail. [ DEAD! ]

The mage had a pet rabbit.  His pet and the wild rabbit were the only

mobs in the room.  He killed the rabbit in that one shot, so that is all

the text there is of the battle.  I'm just curious why it had the

plurality wrong on the rabbit.  Just in case it is relevent, I have opt

numeric turned on.

King cobras..~
Jaime~
Was traversing the desert, pokin' around in random holes and such, when I

disturbed a king cobra.  I got the return that it was squirting venom

into *my* eyes, yet it burned my horse, then I got a line saying it tried

to blind me, but my horse was blinded, it it let me know that clearly.If

the cobra does do random area type attacks, mayhap change the syntax?

Pet Area~
Sythberel~
I have a hyena and its area attack hits me as well as the mobs we are

fighting.  Not sure if this is a bug since the area attack isn't

something that could be directed, but thought there might be a problem

with other pets that have area attacks.

Unconcious underwater~
Gyre~
If you fall unconcious underwater, you shouldn't have to 'get up'

afterwards...  you're floating anyway.  While I haven't checked on it,

the same is probably true for bashing, tripping, etc.  Those strategies

just wouldn't be as effective underwater.

if you do dep all*bronze it allows you to deposit all of the bronze regardless if it's over the bank weight limit.

Elorieth~
When i ask an animal (a deer, for instance) a question, it responds that

it says "a deer tells you: "i know nothing about that."

Last i remmembered, deer didn't respond to questions one asked them... :)

-Elorieth... in hopes that someone didn't already mention this

I don't know about any other places, but in hobgoblins, When I type n .&

kill chief .& look chief .& look incant I attack the chief and look at

the incantrix first, then the chief, even though I typed the chief first.


Nothing important, really, just kinda odd.

Gaines~
After killing the old man on the Northern Sea Trail, I received the

message that the corpse containted a raw stick of jerky and a wineskin of

water.  But when I removed everything from the corpse, I got 2 of

everything, not just one like the original message said should be in

there.  Room number, if needed, is #21073.

Meditate~
Paco~
When i meditat it takes 6 energy.  When i am about out of energy, like i

have 2 points of it left i still gain the maximum amount of hit points. 

I think this should not be like that 

Is it a bug?

Cursed (nodrop) items.~
Raudhrskal~
Might be more of an idea than a bug, but it would be nice to put these

things somewhere safe, such as in our bank accounts or in bags, or maybe

even some kind of special bag..  Not only are they cumbersome, but they

get in the way a _lot_.  They interfere with extra room descriptions, and

just can be annoying in general at times.


--Raudhrskal, who can't 'look stone' or 'look bone' in rooms with those

extra descs.
